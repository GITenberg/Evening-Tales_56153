<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time Mr. Wendell P.
Garrison, the literary editor of <i>The Nation</i>,
sent me a picture he had found in a
catalogue of French books. It represented
a very interesting scene. There were
the Tar-Baby and Brother Rabbit as
natural as life; but Brother Fox was missing.
His place had been supplied by
Brother Billy Goat, whose formidable
horns and fierce beard seemed to add to
the old episode a new danger for poor
Brother Rabbit.</p>

<p>The picture was an advertisement of
<i>Les Contes de la Veill&eacute;e</i>, by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric
Ortoli. After a while the book itself
came to hand, forwarded no doubt by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
some thoughtful American tourist who
had been interested in the Tar-Baby in
French. The volume was examined, and
in some sort relished, laid aside for future
reference, and then forgotten.</p>

<p>But one night after supper the children
of the household were suddenly missing.
There was no romping going on in the
hall. There were no voices to be heard
on the lawn. There was no rippit taking
place in the bedrooms. What could the
matter be? Had the storm-centre moved
in the direction of our innocent neighbors?
The silence was so unusual that it
created a sudden sense of loneliness.</p>

<p>But the investigation that followed
showed that the youngsters had merely
made a temporary surrender of their privileges.
Their mother was reading to them
some of the stories in M. Ortoli's book,
and they were listening with an interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
that childhood can neither affect nor disguise.
I begged permission to make one
of the audience.</p>

<p>"But you have writing to do," said one
of the lads.</p>

<p>"It will disturb you," said one of the
girls.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the lady, who was and is
the centre of this family circle, graciously
made room for one more listener; and
thus it happens that this little volume of
M. Ortoli's stories is in the nature of a
family affair. The lady, for the benefit of
the intruder, was pleased to go over the
stories again, and to read them more slowly,
and thus they were put in their present
form. Most frequently I have preserved
the swift and piquant rendering,
the fluent interpretation that fell from the
lady's lips.</p>

<p>My apologies are perhaps due to M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
Ortoli for a certain freedom of treatment
that has been deemed necessary in some
of the stories. I trust this has not been
carried too far; but in some instances it
has been necessary to English the characters
and incidents as well as the text.
Nevertheless, an effort has been made to
preserve something of the individuality of
M. Ortoli, and I think that at least the
flavor of it will be found in the stories
that follow.</p>

<span class="small">A FRENCH TAR-BABY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the time when there were hobgoblins
and fairies, Brother Goat and Brother
Rabbit lived in the same neighborhood,
not far from each other.</p>

<p>Proud of his long beard and sharp horns,
Brother Goat looked on Brother Rabbit
with disdain. He would hardly speak to
Brother Rabbit when he met him, and his
greatest pleasure was to make his little
neighbor the victim of his tricks and
practical jokes. For instance, he would
say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>"Brother Rabbit, here is Mr. Fox," and
this would cause Brother Rabbit to run
away as hard as he could. Again he would
say:</p>

<p>"Brother Rabbit, here is Mr. Wolf,"
and poor Brother Rabbit would shake and
tremble with fear. Sometimes he would
cry out:</p>

<p>"Brother Rabbit, here is Mr. Tiger,"
and then Brother Rabbit would shudder
and think that his last hour had come.</p>

<p>Tired of this miserable existence, Brother
Rabbit tried to think of some means by
which he could change his powerful and
terrible neighbor into a friend. After a
time, he thought he had discovered a way
to make Brother Goat his friend, and so
he invited him to dinner.</p>

<p>Brother Goat was quick to accept the
invitation. The dinner was a fine affair,
and there was an abundance of good eating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
A great many different dishes were
served. Brother Goat licked his mouth
and shook his long beard with satisfaction.
He had never before been present at such
a feast.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend," exclaimed Brother
Rabbit, when the dessert was brought in,
"how do you like your dinner?"</p>

<p>"I could certainly wish for nothing better,"
replied Brother Goat, rubbing the
tips of his horns against the back of his
chair; "but my throat is very dry and a
little water would hurt neither the dinner
nor me."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" said Brother Rabbit, "I
have neither wine-cellar nor water. I am
not in the habit of drinking while I am
eating."</p>

<p>"Neither have I any water, Brother
Rabbit," said Brother Goat. "But I have
an idea! If you will go with me over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
yonder by the big poplar, we will dig a
well."</p>

<p>"No, Brother Goat," said Brother Rabbit,
who hoped to revenge himself&mdash;"no,
I do not care to dig a well. At daybreak
I drink the dew from the cups of the
flowers, and in the heat of the day I milk
the cows and drink the cream."</p>

<p>"Well and good," said Brother Goat.
"Alone I will dig the well, and alone I
will drink out of it."</p>

<p>"Success to you, Brother Goat," said
Brother Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Brother Rabbit."</p>

<p>Brother Goat then went to the foot of
the big poplar and began to dig his well.
He dug with his forefeet and with his
horns, and the well got deeper and deeper.
Soon the water began to bubble up and
the well was finished, and then Brother
Goat made haste to quench his thirst. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
was in such a hurry that his beard got in
the water, but he drank and drank until
he had his fill.</p>

<p>Brother Rabbit, who had followed him
at a little distance, hid himself behind a
bush and laughed heartily. He said to
himself: "What an innocent creature you
are!"</p>

<p>The next day, when Brother Goat, with
his big beard and sharp horns, returned to
his well to get some water, he saw the
tracks of Brother Rabbit in the soft earth.
This put him to thinking. He sat down,
pulled his beard, scratched his head, and
tapped himself on the forehead.</p>

<p>"My friend," he exclaimed after a while,
"I will catch you yet."</p>

<p>Then he ran and got his tools (for
Brother Goat was something of a carpenter
in those days) and made a large doll
out of laurel wood. When the doll was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
finished, he spread tar on it here and there,
on the right and on the left, and up and
down. He smeared it all over with the
sticky stuff, until it was as black as a
Guinea negro.</p>

<p>This finished, Brother Goat waited
quietly until evening. At sunset he placed
the tarred doll near the well, and ran and
hid himself behind the trees and bushes.
The moon had just risen, and the heavens
twinkled with millions of little star-torches.</p>

<p>Brother Rabbit, who was waiting in his
house, believed that the time had come
for him to get some water, so he took his
bucket and went to Brother Goat's well.
On the way he was very much afraid that
something would catch him. He trembled
when the wind shook the leaves of the
trees. He would go a little distance and
then stop and listen; he hid here behind a
stone, and there behind a tuft of grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>At last he arrived at the well, and there
he saw the little negro. He stopped and
looked at it with astonishment. Then he
drew back a little way, advanced again,
drew back, advanced a little, and stopped
once more.</p>

<p>"What can that be?" he said to himself.
He listened, with his long ears pointed forward,
but the trees could not talk, and the
bushes were dumb. He winked his eyes
and lowered his head:</p>

<p>"Hey, friend! who are you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The tar-doll didn't move. Brother Rabbit
went up a little closer, and asked again:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>The tar-doll said nothing. Brother Rabbit
breathed more at ease. Then he went
to the brink of the well, but when he
looked in the water the tar-doll seemed to
look in too. He could see her reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
in the water. This made Brother Rabbit
so mad that he grew red in the face.</p>

<p>"See here!" he exclaimed, "if you
look in this well I'll give you a rap on the
nose!"</p>

<p>Brother Rabbit leaned over the brink of
the well, and saw the tar-doll smiling at
him in the water. He raised his right
hand and hit her&mdash;bam! His hand
stuck.</p>

<p>"What's this?" exclaimed Brother Rabbit.
"Turn me loose, imp of Satan! If
you do not, I will rap you on the eye with
my other hand."</p>

<p>Then he hit her&mdash;bim! The left hand
stuck also. Then Brother Rabbit raised
his right foot, saying:</p>

<p>"Mark me well, little Congo! Do you
see this foot? I will kick you in the
stomach if you do not turn me loose this
instant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Brother
Rabbit let fly his right foot&mdash;vip! The
foot stuck, and he raised the other.</p>

<p>"Do you see this foot?" he exclaimed.
"If I hit you with it, you will think a
thunderbolt has struck you."</p>

<p>Then he kicked her with the left foot,
and it also stuck like the other, and Brother
Rabbit held fast his Guinea negro.</p>

<p>"Watch out, now!" he cried. "I've
already butted a great many people with
my head. If I butt you in your ugly face
I'll knock it into a jelly. Turn me loose!
Oho! you don't answer?" Bap!</p>

<p>"Guinea girl!" exclaimed Brother Rabbit,
"are you dead? Gracious goodness!
how my head does stick!"</p>

<p>When the sun rose, Brother Goat went
to his well to find out something about
Brother Rabbit. The result was beyond
his expectations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"Hey, little rogue, big rogue!" exclaimed
Brother Goat. "Hey, Brother
Rabbit! what are you doing there? I
thought you drank the dew from the cups
of the flowers, or milk from the cows.
Aha, Brother Rabbit! I will punish you
for stealing my water."</p>

<p>"I am your friend," said Brother Rabbit;
"don't kill me."</p>

<p>"Thief, thief!" cried Brother Goat,
and then he ran quickly into the woods,
gathered up a pile of dry limbs, and made
a great fire. He took Brother Rabbit
from the tar-doll, and prepared to burn
him alive. As he was passing a thicket
of brambles with Brother Rabbit on his
shoulders, Brother Goat met his daughter
B&eacute;l&eacute;die, who was walking about in the
fields.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, papa, muffled
up with such a burden? Come and eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the fresh grass with me, and throw wicked
Brother Rabbit in the brambles."</p>

<p>Cunning Brother Rabbit raised his long
ears and pretended to be very much frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Brother Goat!" he cried.
"Don't throw me in the brambles. They
will tear my flesh, put out my eyes, and
pierce my heart. Oh, I pray you, rather
throw me in the fire."</p>

<p>"Aha, little rogue, big rogue! Aha,
Brother Rabbit!" exclaimed Brother
Goat, exultingly, "you don't like the
brambles? Well, then, go and laugh in
them," and he threw Brother Rabbit in
without a feeling of pity.</p>

<p>Brother Rabbit fell in the brambles,
leaped to his feet, and began to
laugh.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha! Brother Goat, what a simpleton
you are!&mdash;ha-ha-ha! A better bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
I never had! In these brambles I was
born!"</p>

<p>Brother Goat was in despair, but he
could not help himself. Brother Rabbit
was safe.</p>

<p>A long beard is not always a sign of intelligence.</p>

<h2>II<br />
<span class="small">TEENCHY DUCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there lived in a village
in some country (I do not know
where, but certainly nowhere near here),
an old man and an old woman who were
very poor indeed. They had never been
able to save a single penny. They had no
farm, not even a garden. They had nothing
but a little Duck that walked around
on her two feet every day, singing the
song of famine. "Quack! quack! Who
will give me a piece of bread? Quack!
quack! Who will give me a piece of
bread?" This little Duck was so small
that she was named Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>It so happened one day that Teenchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Duck was paddling in the water near the
river's edge when she saw a fine purse
filled with gold. At once she began to
flap her wings and cry: "Quack! quack!
Who has lost his beautiful money?
Quack! quack! Who has lost his beautiful
money?"</p>

<p>Just at that moment the Prince of the
Seven Golden Cows passed along the
road. He was richer than all the kings
and emperors, but he was mean and miserly.
He walked along with a stick in
his hand, and as he walked he counted in
his mind the millions that he had stored
away in his strong-box.</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Who lost his beautiful
money? Quack! quack! Who lost
his beautiful money?" cried Teenchy
Duck.</p>

<p>"I have lost it," brazenly exclaimed the
Prince of the Seven Golden Cows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
then he seized the purse full of money that
Teenchy Duck held in her bill, and went
on his way.</p>

<p>The poor Puddle Duck was so astonished
at this that she could scarcely stand
on her feet.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" she exclaimed, "that
rich lord has kept all for himself and
given me nothing. May he be destroyed
by a pestilence!"</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck at once ran to her master,
and told him what had happened.
When her master learned the value of
what Teenchy Duck had found, and the
trick that had been played on her by the
Prince of the Seven Golden Cows, he
went into a violent rage.</p>

<p>"Why, you big simpleton!" he exclaimed,
"you find money and you do not
bring it to us? You give it to a big lord,
who did not lose it, when we poor people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
need it, so much. Go out of this house
instantly, and don't dare to come back
until you have brought me the purse of
gold!"</p>

<p>Unfortunate Teenchy Duck trembled in
all her limbs, and made herself small and
humble; but she found voice to say:</p>

<p>"You are right, my master! I go at
once to find the Prince of the Seven
Golden Cows."</p>

<p>But once out of doors the poor Puddle
Duck thought to herself sorrowfully:
"How and where can I find the Prince
who was so mean as to steal the beautiful
money?"</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck was so bewildered that
she began to strike her head against the
rocks in despair. Suddenly an idea came
into her mind. She would follow his
tracks, and the marks that his walking-stick
made in the ground until she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
to the castle of the Prince of the Seven
Golden Cows.</p>

<p>No sooner thought than done. Teenchy
Duck went waddling down the road in the
direction taken by the miserly Prince, crying,
with all her might:</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money! Quack! quack! Give
me back my beautiful money!"</p>

<p>Brother Fox, who was taking his ease a
little way from the road, heard Teenchy
Duck's cries, and knew her voice. He
went to her and said:</p>

<p>"What in the world is the matter with
you, my poor Teenchy Duck? You look
sad and broken-hearted."</p>

<p>"I have good reason to be," said
Teenchy Duck. "This morning, while
paddling in the river, I found a purse
full of gold, and gave it to the Prince of
the Seven Golden Cows, thinking it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
his. But now, here comes my master and
asks me for it, and says he will kill me if
I do not bring it to him pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Well, where are you going in this
style?" asked Brother Fox.</p>

<p>"I am going straight to the Prince of
the Seven Golden Cows," said Teenchy
Duck.</p>

<p>"Shall I go with you?" asked Brother
Fox.</p>

<p>"I'd be only too glad if you would,"
exclaimed Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>"But how can I go?" said Brother
Fox.</p>

<p>"Get in my satchel," said Teenchy
Duck, "and I'll carry you the best I know
how."</p>

<p>"It isn't big enough," said Brother
Fox.</p>

<p>"It will stretch," said Teenchy Duck.
So Brother Fox got in the satchel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Teenchy Duck went waddling along the
road, crying: "Quack! quack! Give me
back my beautiful money!"</p>

<p>She had not gone far when she met
Brother Wolf, who was passing that way.</p>

<p>"What are you crying so for?" he inquired.
"One would think you were going
to die on the journey."</p>

<p>"It is only too true," said Teenchy
Duck, and then she told Brother Wolf
about finding the money-purse, just as she
had told Brother Fox.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can be of some service to
you," said Brother Wolf. "Shall I go with
you?"</p>

<p>"I am willing," said Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>"But how can I go so far?" Brother
Wolf asked.</p>

<p>"Get in my satchel," said Teenchy
Duck, "and I'll carry you as I can."</p>

<p>"It is too small," said Brother Wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"It will stretch mightily," said Teenchy
Duck.</p>

<p>Then Brother Wolf went to keep company
with Brother Fox.</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck went on her way again.
She didn't walk very fast, for her satchel
was heavy; but she never ceased crying:
"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money."</p>

<p>Now it happened, as she was going
along, she came up with a Ladder, which
said, without asking after her health:</p>

<p>"My poor Teenchy Duck! You do
not seem to be very happy."</p>

<p>"I should think not!" exclaimed
Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>"What can the matter be?" the Ladder
asked.</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck then told her story over
again.</p>

<p>"I am not doing anything at present,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
said the Ladder; "shall I go with
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>"But how can I go, I who never walk?"
inquired the Ladder.</p>

<p>"Why, get in my satchel," said Teenchy
Duck, "and I'll carry you the best I know
how."</p>

<p>The Ladder was soon in the satchel
with Brother Fox and Brother Wolf, and
Teenchy Duck went on her way, following
the tracks of the Prince of the Seven
Golden Cows, and always crying:</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>Going along and crying thus, Teenchy
Duck came to her best and oldest friend,
the River.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" said the
River, in astonishment, "and why are
you crying so? When I saw you this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
morning you seemed to be very happy."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Teenchy Duck, "would you
believe it? I have not eaten since yesterday."</p>

<p>"And why not?" asked the sympathetic
River.</p>

<p>"You saw me find the purse of gold,"
said Teenchy Duck, "and you saw the
Prince seize it. Ah, well! my master will
kill me if I do not get it and return it to
him."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," the River replied, "a
little help does a great deal of good. Shall
I go with you?"</p>

<p>"I should be very happy," said Teenchy
Duck.</p>

<p>"But how can I follow you&mdash;I that
have no limbs?" said the River.</p>

<p>"Get in my satchel," said Teenchy
Duck. "I'll carry you as I can."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>Then the River got in the satchel by the
side of the other friends of Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>She went on her journey, keeping her
eyes on the ground, so as not to lose sight
of the tracks of the thief, but still crying
for her beautiful money. On her way she
came to a Bee-Hive, which had a mind to
laugh because Teenchy Duck was carrying
such a burden.</p>

<p>"Hey, my poor Teenchy Duck! What
a big, fat satchel you have there!" said the
Bee-Hive.</p>

<p>"I'm not in the humor for joking, my
dear," said Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>"Why are you so sad?"</p>

<p>"I have been very unfortunate, good
little people," said Teenchy Duck, addressing
herself to the Bees, and then she
told her story.</p>

<p>"Shall we go with you?" asked the
Bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed Teenchy Duck.
"In these days of sorrow I stand in need
of friends."</p>

<p>"How shall we follow you?" asked the
Bees.</p>

<p>"Get in my satchel," said Teenchy
Duck. "I'll carry you the best I know
how."</p>

<p>Then the Bees shook their wings for
joy and swarmed into the satchel along
with the other friends of Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>She resumed her journey, always crying
for the return of her beautiful money.
She walked and walked without stopping
to rest a moment, until her legs almost
refused to carry her. At last, just as
night was coming on, Teenchy Duck saw
with joy that the tracks of the Prince of
the Seven Golden Cows stopped at the
iron gate that barred the way to a splendid
castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, "I have arrived
at my journey's end, and I have no need to
knock on the gate. I will creep under."</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck entered the grounds and
cried out: "Quack! quack! Give me my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>The Prince heard her and laughed scornfully.
How could a poor Teenchy Duck
compel a great lord to return the purse of
gold?</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck continued to cry:</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>It was night, and the Prince of the
Seven Golden Cows ordered one of his
servants to take Teenchy Duck and shut
her up in the hennery with the turkeys,
the geese, and the chickens, thinking that
these fowls would kill the stranger, and
that her disagreeable song would forever
be at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>This order was immediately carried out
by the servant, but no sooner had Teenchy
Duck entered the hennery than she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Brother Fox, if you do not come to
my assistance I am lost!"</p>

<p>Brother Fox came out of the satchel
promptly, and worked so well at his trade
that of all the fowls he found there not
one remained alive.</p>

<p>At break of day the servant-girl, whose
business it was to attend to the poultry-yard,
opened the door of the hennery,
and was astounded to see Teenchy
Duck come out, singing the same old
song:</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>The astonished girl immediately ran and
told her master, the Prince, what had happened,
and the wife of the Prince, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
had at that moment learned all, said to her
husband:</p>

<p>"This Duck is a Witch. Give her the
money, or it will bring us bad luck."</p>

<p>The Prince of the Seven Golden Cows
refused to listen to any advice. He believed
that the fox had only happened to
enter his hennery by accident.</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck made herself heard all
day, and at night the Prince said to his
servants:</p>

<p>"Take this squaller and throw her in
the stable under the feet of the mules and
horses. We will see in the morning what
she will say."</p>

<p>The servants obeyed, and Teenchy Duck
immediately cried:</p>

<p>"Brother Wolf, if you do not come
quickly to my aid I shall be killed."</p>

<p>Brother Wolf made no delay, and it
was not long before he had destroyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
horses and the mules. Next morning,
before day, the servants went to get the
animals to put them to the ploughs and
wagons; but when they saw them lying
dead their astonishment was indescribable.
In the stable Teenchy Duck stood alone,
singing, in her most beautiful voice:</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>When the Prince of the Seven Golden
Cows heard of this disaster he became
white with rage, and in his fury he wanted
to give his servants a thousand lashes for
not having taken necessary precautions
against the Wolf. But his wife calmed
him little by little, saying:</p>

<p>"My husband, give back to Teenchy
Duck this purse you have taken, or else
we shall be ruined."</p>

<p>"No," cried the Prince, "she shall
never have it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>All this time Teenchy Duck was promenading
up and down, to the right and to
the left, singing, at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>"Quack! quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>"Heavens!" said the Prince, stopping
his ears, "I am tired of hearing this ugly
fowl squall and squawk. Quick! throw
her in the well or the furnace, so that we
may be rid of her."</p>

<p>"What shall we do first?" the servants
asked.</p>

<p>"It matters not," said the Prince, "so
long as we are rid of her."</p>

<p>The servants took Teenchy Duck and
threw her in the well, thinking this the
easiest and the quickest way to dispose of
her.</p>

<p>As Teenchy Duck was falling, she cried:
"Come to my assistance, good Ladder, or
I am undone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>The Ladder immediately came out of
the satchel, and leaned against the walls
of the well. Teenchy Duck came up the
rounds, singing:</p>

<p>"Quack, quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>Everybody was astonished, and the
Prince's wife kept saying: "Give this
witch her money."</p>

<p>"They would say that I am afraid of a
Teenchy Duck," said the Prince of the
Seven Golden Cows. "I will never give
it up." Then, speaking to his servants,
he said: "Heat the oven; heat it to a
white heat, and throw this witch in."</p>

<p>The servants were compelled to obey,
but they were so frightened that none
dared touch her. At last, one bolder than
the rest seized her by the end of the wing
and threw her in the red-hot oven. Everybody
thought that this was the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Teenchy Duck, but she had had time to
cry out:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear friend River, come to
my assistance, or I shall be roasted."</p>

<p>The River rushed out and quenched the
fire and cooled the oven.</p>

<p>When the Prince went to see what was
left of Teenchy Duck, she met him, and
began to repeat her familiar refrain:</p>

<p>"Quack, quack! Give me back my
beautiful money!"</p>

<p>The Prince of the Seven Golden Cows
was furious.</p>

<p>"You are all blockheads!" he cried to
his servants. "You never knew how to
do anything. Get out of here! I will
drive you off the place! Hereafter I will
take charge of this fiend myself."</p>

<p>That night, before retiring, the Prince
and his wife went and got Teenchy Duck,
and prepared to give her such a beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
as they had no doubt would cause her
death.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Teenchy Duck saw the
danger and cried out:</p>

<p>"Friend Bees! come out and help me."</p>

<p>A buzzing sound was heard, and then
the Bees swarmed on the Prince and his
wife, and stung them so terribly that they
became frightful to behold.</p>

<p>"Return the money to this ugly witch,"
groaned the unfortunate wife. "Run, or
we are done for."</p>

<p>The Prince did not wait to be told
twice. He ran and got the purse full of
gold, and returned it to Teenchy Duck.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "I am conquered.
But get out of my grounds quickly."</p>

<p>Full of joy, Teenchy Duck went out
into the road singing: "Quack, quack!
I have got my beautiful money! Quack,
quack! Here is my beautiful money!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>On her way home she returned the
friends that had aided her to the places
where she had found them, thanking them
kindly for their assistance in time of need.</p>

<p>At break of day Teenchy Duck found
herself at her master's door. She aroused
him by her loud cries. After that, the
family was rich, but the master and mistress
were not happy, for they knew the
money did not belong to them.</p>

<p>Teenchy Duck was well taken care of,
and grew to be large and fat. If she went
to the village pond at all, it was only to
take a bath with her comrades and to tell
a certain Duck of her remarkable exploit
of recovering the beautiful money.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>III<br />
<span class="small">MR. SNAIL AND BROTHER WOLF</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One night, in the season when the hawthorn
flowers were blooming and perfuming
the air, Brother Wolf came out of the
woods, and ran down the hill in a brisk
gallop. A little Snail saw Brother Wolf&mdash;a
little Snail, who, to accommodate himself,
carried his house on his back and his horns
on his head. He was a very funny little
Snail; and, as Brother Wolf was passing,
he laughed aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he!"</p>

<p>Hearing this, Brother Wolf paused,
turned around, and said:</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh, little Snail?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do I laugh?" exclaimed Mr.
Snail.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Brother Wolf. "Do you
see anything ridiculous about me?"</p>

<p>"No, Brother Wolf," said Mr. Snail;
"on the contrary, you make a very fine
appearance. You have on your Sunday
clothes, and you are handsome indeed.
No, Brother Wolf, you are not at all ridiculous."</p>

<p>"Why, then, this laughter?" inquired
Brother Wolf. "Answer me at once, for
I am in a hurry. Speak this instant, or it
will not be well for you."</p>

<p>"Do not get angry, Brother Wolf; it is
not worth while. I only laughed to see
you running so fast when neither dogs nor
men were pursuing you. Where are you
going in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the city," said Brother
Wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"To the city?" exclaimed Mr. Snail.
"What do you propose to do there?"</p>

<p>"I want to see my brother, who is sick
in the menagerie. He has written me to
come to him."</p>

<p>"That is very queer," said Mr. Snail.
"I am going to the city also."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed Brother Wolf, contemptuously.
"Hens will have teeth and
sows side-pockets before you get there."</p>

<p>Mr. Snail felt himself somewhat insulted
at Brother Wolf's remark, and replied:</p>

<p>"I do not know how long it takes a
hen to have teeth; but one thing I do
know, and that is, that I will arrive in the
city before you do."</p>

<p>"You have no legs, and you carry your
house on your back," said Brother Wolf;
"how will you manage to get there?"</p>

<p>"Don't trouble about that," said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Snail. "My house is mine, and I do not
need legs. I will be in the city before
you."</p>

<p>"You make me very tired with your
talk," said Brother Wolf. "If you are
not joking, let us wager a breakfast that
you do not get there first&mdash;that is, if you
are not joking."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Mr. Snail, "let
it be a breakfast. I even give you three
jumps in advance, and after that you may
gallop."</p>

<p>While Brother Wolf was making ready
for the start, Mr. Snail crawled up on his
tail. When the signal was given, the
Wolf hurried on, going very rapidly and
without a moment's rest. He arrived in
the city the next day; but found the gates
closed. Brother Wolf knocked very hard,
and waited for some one to come and
admit him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>During this time Mr. Snail dropped on
the ground and climbed on the wall.</p>

<p>"Is that you, my friend?" he exclaimed.
"I have been waiting for you a
long time. I am hungry now, and want
my breakfast."</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<span class="small">THE LION'S SECRET</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there were two brothers,
who were orphans. The oldest was
named Mahobane and the youngest Lovallec.
These unfortunate children had
been beggars since they were six years of
age. They went from house to house and
from village to village, on mountains and
in valleys, but wherever they went their
cry was the same:</p>

<p>"Good friends! give us alms! Kind
friends! help the unfortunate!"</p>

<p>Their lot was a hard one, even as children,
but it was harder as they grew older,
for when the oldest was twenty they discovered
that they had only succeeded, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
all their efforts, in keeping soul and body
together. Finally, one day, Mahobane
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I know what I shall do to make a
great deal of money in a very short time."</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Lovallec.</p>

<p>"One of us," said the eldest, "will have
to become blind and lead the other by the
hand, going from house to house and
along the public highways asking for alms
from the people and from the travellers."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Lovallec, "but,
alas! neither one of us is blind."</p>

<p>"It will be easy enough," said the other,
"to become so."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" asked Lovallec.</p>

<p>"Oh, easy enough," said the elder.
"One of us will have to put out his eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" exclaimed the younger;
"that would make one of us suffer too
much."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said Mahobane, to the younger,
"you are timid, you are tender-hearted:
What is a little suffering in comparison
with the happy times we should have? the
soft beds we should sleep in, the fine meats
that will be offered us, and the good wines
we have not tasted in so long? But it
does not follow that you are to be blind,"
continued Mahobane; "the lot may fall to
me instead of you."</p>

<p>"So be it," said the younger; "let us
draw straws."</p>

<p>Mahobane prepared the straws, and arranged
very cleverly to cheat his younger
brother. He had no sooner carried his
point than he put out his brother's eyes
with a thorn.</p>

<p>Lovallec screamed loudly under the
pain of this operation, but the only sympathy
he got from his cruel brother was
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>"Cry louder, my brother! cry louder!
for here the people are passing, and when
they behold your condition they will give
us money."</p>

<p>It was even so. Silver and pennies fell
into the wooden bowl they carried, and
this success was continued for more than a
year. Then a wicked thought entered the
head of Mahobane, the eldest, and he
made up his mind to get rid of his unfortunate
brother. So one day he carried
him into the great forest and left him to
wander alone and find his way out as best
he could; but, being blind, this he was unable
to do.</p>

<p>"Where am I, my dear brother?
Where are you?" But there was no answer
to his heart-rending cries. The cowardly
brother, who had deserted him, was
already far away. It was long before Lovallec,
the blind one, would believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
his brother could be cruel enough to desert
him. He called and cried for the absent
brother, but the only answer he heard
was in the mocking echoes. Night came,
and he was tired, hungry, and thirsty.
Despair seized him and he continued his
lamentations.</p>

<p>"Ah, my brother! my brother! how
cruel you have been to forsake me! Is it
my fate to die of hunger at the foot of
this tree, or become the prey of the ravenous
beasts that roam through this forest?
No! Better a thousand times that I
should die at once."</p>

<p>With this the unfortunate brother
climbed the tree, at the foot of which he
found himself, groping his way up the
trunk, and was preparing to throw himself
to the ground to end his existence then
and there, when he heard in the forest,
near at hand, the terrible roaring of a lion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
At this sound the leaves and branches of
the tree trembled, and the blind unfortunate
paused. The roaring of the Lion,
as it seemed, was a call to the Wolf, who
soon made his appearance at the foot of
the tree.</p>

<p>"You are late, Wolf!" exclaimed the
Lion; "where do you come from?"</p>

<p>"I have been at Offemborough," said
the Wolf, "where I have tasted human
flesh. There everyone is dying of thirst,
and the people are too weak to protect
themselves. That is why I am late." At
this the Lion laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"I know," said he, "how water can be
procured for the inhabitants of this city."</p>

<p>"But how can this be done?" the Wolf
inquired.</p>

<p>"It is easy enough," said the Lion, in his
positive way; "take a small piece of the
root of this very tree under which we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
standing, and strike three times on the
rock in the middle of the city, saying:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"'Come, gentle Dew, from the skies,</div>
<div class="i0">Refreshing Fountains rise,</div>
<div class="i0">Oh, Rivers! greet men's eyes!'</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="in0">and immediately water, fresh and clear as
crystal will flow, and it will flow in sufficient
abundance to satisfy the needs of
all."</p>

<p>"You are wise," said the Wolf. "Can
you not give me some other useful information?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lion, "I can tell you a
remedy that will cure all sorts of maladies
and infirmities."</p>

<p>"What is that?" said the Wolf.</p>

<p>"To succeed in the art of medicine,"
said the Lion, shaking his mane and beard,
"one has only to take the inner bark of
this same tree, and apply it to the seat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the disease. For example, if one is blind,
a portion of the inner bark of the tree
would have to be applied to the eyes."</p>

<p>"That is very strange," said the Wolf,
"and I will remember it. But now tell
me from whence you come: I have not
seen you for many days."</p>

<p>"I have just arrived from the city of
the famous King, whose beautiful daughter
now lies dangerously ill."</p>

<p>"And how did the famous King's beautiful
daughter come to be ill?" inquired
the Wolf.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Lion, "as I was passing
over the mountain of Aventin, I met
the King's daughter riding on a palfrey.
She was smiling on all, and giving alms to
every unfortunate she met. She was so
beautiful, with her great blue eyes, and so
simple and so good, that it made me lonely
and lovesick, so I caused to be sent her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
terrible malady which will consume her,
and to-day she should be dying."</p>

<p>"Do you think," said the Wolf, "that
the inner bark of this tree would cure the
sick princess?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Lion. "It would not
be sufficient in this case, for the princess
has an evil spirit for an enemy, and she
will have to be treated differently. To be
cured, she must be given the blood of a
frog mixed with muscadine wine, and the
second day she must eat the frog's heart
cooked in the juice of a fig."</p>

<p>Here the Lion paused, and the Wolf
inquired:</p>

<p>"Have you no more good news for me,
good friend?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Lion.</p>

<p>"Then good-by until next year," said
the Wolf, "when we will meet at the same
time and place."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>The Wolf and the Lion parted, each
going his way through the forest.</p>

<p>"So, then," exclaimed Lovallec, the
blind man, who had been sitting in the
tree, "I have not been deserted by Providence
after all. These beasts have told
me secrets that will surely be useful to me
hereafter."</p>

<p>The sun had arisen, and the birds began
to sing. Lovallec came down from the
tree and took a piece of the inner bark
thereof and rubbed it on his eyes. Suddenly
he found that his eyesight had been
restored to him, and the happy man danced
around in a transport of joy. He saw the
skies, the birds, the flowers, and, above
all, the sun. He was happy once more.
He placed the bark in his bosom and
pressed it there, after securing a quantity
of the precious medicine. He did not forget,
also, to procure a piece of the root of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
the tree, in order that he might be able to
give water to the unfortunate inhabitants
of Offemborough.</p>

<p>After making these preparations the
young man started on his journey. He
travelled for many days and crossed many
rivers. He was nearly at the end of his
journey, but he was as poor now as when
he started, and his clothes were in tatters.
He had no money, but his riches were
all in his heart. He met a priest.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, parson," said he; "can
I enjoy your hospitality?"</p>

<p>"No," said the priest, "my house is
too small and I have no place for you."</p>

<p>He met the mayor.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. Mayor," Lovallec exclaimed,
"will you give me something to
eat?"</p>

<p>"Go away, you tramp, or I will have
you arrested this instant," cried the mayor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>He met the lord of the castle.</p>

<p>"Good-day," said the traveller. "I am
cold, your lordship; can you give me some
clothing to wear&mdash;something to hide my
nakedness?"</p>

<p>Then the lord of the castle called to
his servants and directed them to give the
beggar a hundred lashes, and the unfortunate
young man was beat and left for dead
on the way.</p>

<p>A poor girl, passing by, saw him lying
on the ground, and bent over him tenderly.
Then she called assistance, and
had him carried to her home, where she
watched over him constantly, weeping and
praying that he might recover.</p>

<p>At last Lovallec recovered, and said to
the young girl who had rescued him:</p>

<p>"My guardian angel, what has happened
since I have been ill? What is the
news in the city?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"There is nothing new," said the young
girl. "Every one is the victim of the
water-famine."</p>

<p>"What a misfortune!" cried the young
man; "let us go at once to the relief of
these poor people!"</p>

<p>Although Lovallec was scarcely able to
walk, he leaned on the arm of the young
girl, and was preparing to go, when, all of
a sudden, he remembered the pieces of
bark he had secreted in his bosom. He
took a portion of this, rubbed himself, and
at once the pains in his limbs disappeared,
and he was made whole again.</p>

<p>The young girl was astonished at this
sudden change, as well she might be, and
her surprise continued until they had arrived
in the centre of the great city.
Once there, however, the young man recognized
the rock that had been described
by the Lion. Without loss of time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
took the piece of the root of the tree that
he had procured, and struck the rock three
times, crying:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Come, gentle Dew, from the skies,</div>
<div class="i0">Refreshing Fountains rise,</div>
<div class="i0">Oh, Rivers! greet men's eyes!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At once there was a mysterious noise
in the rock. It parted in twain, and the
water gushed forth in an abundant supply.
The news of this miracle spread abroad in
the city, and the inhabitants came with
their jugs and vessels to obtain a supply of
water. All quenched their thirst, and
were happy; they embraced each other
and made ready for celebrating the event
with festivities. They were so grateful
that they could talk of nothing else but
the miracle that had given them an abundance
of water.</p>

<p>But in the midst of their congratulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and rejoicings a voice rose above the tumult:</p>

<p>"Friends, let us not be ungrateful. To
whom do we owe this abundance of water
that has given us renewed strength and
life?"</p>

<p>When Lovallec heard these words he
made an effort to escape the notice of the
crowd, but the young girl could not resist
a desire to make him known to the people.
She cried out:</p>

<p>"Here is the saviour of Offemborough!"</p>

<p>At this the young man was surrounded
by the priest, the mayor, and the lord of
the castle, and they wanted to carry him
off in triumph. They offered him great
sums of money as a reward for the service
he had rendered them; but simple and
modest as the young man was, he answered:</p>

<p>"No, no! keep all your money. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
have none of that. I was without a shelter,
and you drove me from your door; I
was dying of hunger, and you refused me
even the scraps that you fed to your
dogs; I was shivering with cold, and all
the clothing you gave me was a beating,
and I was left for dead on the pavement.
Ah! keep your honors; keep your
money!"</p>

<p>At these sad words, and, fearing that
the young man would destroy the source
of their water as quickly as he had discovered
it, the men, women, and children
fell on their knees before him and begged
for mercy. He bade them rise, and he
was weeping as he spoke:</p>

<p>"Your kindness is my best revenge."</p>

<p>Then the people asked Lovallec to make
his home among them.</p>

<p>"No! no!" he answered, "I have a
great deal of good to do as I journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
through the world, and those who are suffering
cannot afford to wait."</p>

<p>The people of Offemborough, however,
persuaded him to accept a magnificent carriage
and horses; they clothed him in fine
linen and gave him money to go on his way.</p>

<p>"When will you return to us?" inquired
the people.</p>

<p>"Very soon, perhaps, my friends," cried
Lovallec, and with that his driver whipped
up the horses, and the young man was
soon lost to view.</p>

<p>After so long a time, Lovallec, arriving
at the city of the famous King, went immediately
to the palace-door and knocked.</p>

<p>"What will you have?" said the King,
who went to the door.</p>

<p>"Living in a far-off country I heard
that your daughter is sick, and I have
come to cure her."</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried the King, "you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
come in vain. All the great physicians of
the world have exhausted their science in
her behalf, and I am in despair."</p>

<p>"You must have courage," said the
young man; "your daughter will be cured
in a few days."</p>

<p>"Stranger," said the famous monarch,
"if you can work such a wonderful miracle
as this, all that I have is yours. The
riches that will fall to you will be beyond
computation. You shall have millions of
gold pieces, a hundred towns and ten
provinces shall be yours, and you may
even command my crown if you succeed
in curing my daughter."</p>

<p>Then Lovallec thanked the famous
King and said:</p>

<p>"Leave me alone a little while, as it is
necessary that I should gather some herbs
that belong to the medicine which I desire
to give your daughter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>Then the famous King went weeping
to his daughter's bedside. The
young man went down into the garden
and caught a frog, and went to the
apartments that had been provided for
him.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he exclaimed to one of the
servants, "bring me a knife and a plate
and some green figs; and you," he said to
another, "make a big fire, and don't forget
to fetch a frying-pan."</p>

<p>Everything was ready in a short time,
and Lovallec went to work, having first
made sure that there was nobody near to
watch him. He first killed the frog and
mixed its blood with muscadine wine.
Then he took out the heart, and cooked it
as the Lion had said. This mixture prepared,
the young man went before the
King's daughter.</p>

<p>"Powerful princess!" he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
"drink of this wine, for it is renewed life
that I give you."</p>

<p>The princess drank one swallow, and
immediately pushed the cup from her.</p>

<p>"I am poisoned!" she cried; "I feel
that I am dying."</p>

<p>"Drink, princess, drink!" exclaimed
the young man, "for it is an evil spirit that
possesses you."</p>

<p>Then the young girl took the rest
of the draught, and was immediately relieved.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am better," she exclaimed.
"I feel my strength returning. Thanks!
thanks! my benefactor!"</p>

<p>The next day Lovallec presented her
with the heart of the frog, cooked according
to the Lion's directions.</p>

<p>"Eat this meat," the young man said,
"and all your troubles will be over."</p>

<p>Then the sick girl ate bravely of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
queer morsel, and was immediately restored
to health.</p>

<p>"My father! my father!" she cried,
"here is your daughter who is restored to
you. See my bright eyes and my rosy
cheeks." Then she laughed and sang, and
with a smile she again thanked her benefactor.</p>

<p>The old King was nearly crazed with
joy, and more than once he went to the
young man and embraced him; but that
seemed insufficient as an expression of the
gratitude that he owed the doctor, and he
was loaded with presents of all sorts. He
had caskets of gold, precious stones, villages
and castles, and more riches than he
could wish for. One day the King said to
him:</p>

<p>"My son, I want to give you my daughter's
hand in marriage, and my crown, if
you will accept it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said Lovallec, "permit
me to think over your proposition. I desire
to return to a foreign country to arrange
my affairs, and later I can give you
an answer."</p>

<p>"Go, my son," said the King, "but return
quickly. The hours seem long to
those who love and wait."</p>

<p>The young man went away that very
day. Where he was going he alone knew,
but his horses seemed to know where his
heart turned, and he soon found himself
on the way to Offemborough, where one
poor woman had had pity on him. It
was not long before he had reached the
end of his journey. He stopped at the
best hotel and had a magnificent dinner
set before him. After dining he said to
the landlord:</p>

<p>"My friend, what is new in the city?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the landlord, "except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
that the marvellous palace, built for the
saviour of this city has been completed."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" inquired Lovallec.</p>

<p>"Alas! no one knows," said the landlord.
"He was merely passing through
this land to a foreign country, where he
had other good deeds to perform. When
he returns we hope to have him remain
with us, and it is our purpose to give him
the most beautiful woman of the country
for his bride."</p>

<p>"Good-night, good-night," said Lovallec,
with a smile, and went to bed.</p>

<p>But the news of his arrival spread
through the village, and on all sides the
grateful people came to see him and congratulate
him. The mayor of the town
called on him, made a beautiful speech,
and invited him to take possession of the
marvellous palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"What will I do with it?" asked Lovallec.
"I am alone and have no family."</p>

<p>"Then get you a wife," said the mayor.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Lovallec. "To-morrow
I will choose me a wife from the
beautiful girls of this village."</p>

<p>The next day the maidens were gathered
on the lawn before the church. The young
man inspected them carefully, but he could
not find among them the girl who had befriended
him, and for whom he was searching.</p>

<p>The day after, the working-girls were
ranged on the lawn, and among these, the
simplest and the most beautiful, he found
the maiden who had given him aid in the
hour of need. This maiden he selected
to be his wife in preference to the princess
in the far country.</p>

<p>He married her and was living happily,
when one day a beggar, clothed in rags,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
made his appearance at the castle-door and
asked for alms.</p>

<p>"You seem to have seen trouble,"
Lovallec said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the beggar, "and I have
deserved it all."</p>

<p>With that he went on to relate, amid
tears and sobs, how, many years before,
he had robbed a brother of his eyesight.
Lovallec had already recognized him, but
he permitted the poor man to tell his
story, and then made himself known.
And after that they both lived happily
together in the palace which the gratitude
of the people had provided.</p>

<h2>V<br />
<span class="small">THE KING AND THE LAPWINGS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One day the great King of the Magicians
and Sorcerers was leaving his country to
visit a neighboring Queen. He was leaning
on his walking-stick, having been travelling
since the break of day, when the
sun rose and spread his beneficent rays
over all nature. The birds sang blithely,
and the little crickets in the grass made
themselves noisy; but the King, while enjoying
the scene and the sounds around
him, went forward without delay. The
sun shone brightly, the birds were joyous,
and all nature seemed to be happy, but the
King suffered from fatigue. Great beads
of perspiration broke out on his forehead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and he longed for a cloud that would give
shade and coolness. The earth seemed to
be a furnace. The sun spread its great
rays of light and the cloud came not. The
King begged for a clump of woods that
he might have the benefit of shade, and
for a stream of cool and sparkling water
that he might quench his thirst. The
road was long and dusty, and the wells
were dry.</p>

<p>But in the air, far away, appeared the
King of the Lapwings. He bore in
his beak a draught of water, and his
wings were dripping wet. Faster than
the wind he made his way to the dying
King.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the bird, "it was indeed time
that I came;" and with the end of his wing,
as tenderly as would a mother, he washed
the face of the unfortunate King, and
placed between his lips the water he held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
in his beak. The King revived and
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, thou," he exclaimed, "who gave
me back my life! I am hereafter under
all obligations to you."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, your majesty," said
the King of the Lapwings; "thirst still devours
you, but have hope. Behold in the
distance my faithful subjects, who come
forth, each one carrying at the end of its
wings the delightful refreshment you have
longed for."</p>

<p>The lapwings arrived on all sides. Each
one deposited in the mouth of the unfortunate
King the fresh water for which he
thirsted.</p>

<p>"Ah, this is better than bread," said the
King, reviving; "what can I do to show
my gratitude?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the King of the Lapwings.
"Nothing," responded the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
birds. "Continue your journey, and you
will find yourself hereafter under the
shadow of our wings."</p>

<p>Then the King resumed his journey.
Night came, and he found himself near
the palace of the Queen whom he had
intended to visit. The lapwings still continued
with him. No matter how bright
the sun shone, no matter how suffocating
the heat as he journeyed on, a gentle lapwing
came to his assistance. Touched by
the solicitude of these birds the King
said:</p>

<p>"I cannot leave you, my friends, you
who had pity on me when I was forsaken
by all, without giving you a substantial
evidence of my gratitude. Tell me, what
can I do for you? How can I show you
how grateful I am?"</p>

<p>At these words the King of the Lapwings
advanced and spoke to the King:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>"We desire, your majesty, to be the
most beautiful of birds. We want a
golden crown on our heads, so that we
may be placed before the peacock, who is
so proud of his plumage, and before the
gay nightingale, who is so proud of his
song."</p>

<p>At these words a great sadness filled
the heart of the King, who could read the
future, and he responded, shaking his
head:</p>

<p>"Ah! you foolish birds, larger of heart
than of mind! you do not know the weight
of a crown and of the numberless dangers
to which it exposes those who possess it.
A golden diadem, say you? Alas! it will
bring you misfortune; ambition without
bounds is wicked and perilous. Dear
friends, demand of me something else."</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the lapwings, on all
sides, young and old, little and big, "that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
is the only gift we desire&mdash;a crown on our
heads. Ah, what happiness! We will
fly in the air and each bird will envy us."</p>

<p>The King then saw that nothing he
could say would convince his companions.
He had promised to satisfy their first request,
and his word was sacred.</p>

<p>"Come with me," said he, "to my
friend, the magician Zacchar. No one is
more expert in the working of metal. At
his touch iron becomes more supple, silver
becomes malleable, and gold is mere paste.
Come! and you shall have the diadem
you long for."</p>

<p>During three days the magician worked
pure gold. The bellows blew and the
hammers thumped. During three nights
he chased the marvellous crowns that were
to adorn the heads of the lapwings. At
the dawn of the fourth day the King arrived,
with a sad smile on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"Friends," said he to the birds, "my
promise is fulfilled. Take these diadems;
take these diadems, which are masterpieces
of art, and go whither your destiny calls
you."</p>

<p>At these words the lapwings uttered
loud cries of joy.</p>

<p>"Go, go," cried the King, "escape from
man or you are lost."</p>

<p>Without understanding his warning, but
obeying the command of the powerful
King, the lapwings took flight, filled with
joy and happiness. They went here and
there, flying to the tops of the mountains
and descending to the depths of the valleys,
telling of their good fortune to all
their friends both far and wide.</p>

<p>When the other birds saw the crowns
with which the heads of the lapwings were
encircled they paid due homage to the
symbols. Whenever there was a feast or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
an important funeral the lapwings and
their friends walked in the place of honor,
before the eagles and the peafowls, leaving
far behind them the humming-bird
(that living flower), the linnet, and the
nightingale.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, it happened one day
that a lapwing came too near the abode
of man, and a hunter saw it and killed it.</p>

<p>"What is this?" exclaimed the sportsman,
perceiving the golden crown. Seizing
it, he ran quickly to the jeweller's.</p>

<p>"Worker in metals!" said he, "see this
marvellous diadem the lapwing carries!
Of what metal is it made?"</p>

<p>The jeweller took the crown, turned it
on all sides, and looking at it with greedy
eyes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It is of pure gold, and if you will part
with it I will pay you an hundred shekels."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>When the other sportsmen found out
the value of the ornament that the lapwings
wore on their heads, they made
haste to go into the country, and they pursued
the lapwings, wherever they could find
them. New weapons were invented, and
the hunters watched day and night, killing
all the lapwings that were so unfortunate
as to appear in sight.</p>

<p>"Lord, have mercy on us!" exclaimed
the lapwings, "and blind the eyes of the
cruel men who are killing us!"</p>

<p>But the crown of the lapwings was so
brilliant that it resembled the sun's rays,
and even in the darkness it shone like the
stars. There was no rest or escape for
these unfortunate birds. The dark night,
even, was as fatal to them as the day.
The huntsmen pursued them with so much
vigor that only ten remained alive.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" asked the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
of the Lapwings, who had not yet been
destroyed. "Let us go and implore the
great King to relieve us of these golden
crowns that are the cause of all our misfortunes."</p>

<p>Immediately the lapwings started on
their journey in search of the great King.
Some of them stopped by the way, so that
only a few reached the King's throne,
where they were welcomed, the powerful
ruler talking to them kindly as he would
have talked to faithful friends.</p>

<p>"Lapwings with the golden diadems!
My dear companions, what can I do to
please you this day?"</p>

<p>"Great Prince!" they replied, "you can
give us our lives by removing these unfortunate
gifts that adorn our heads&mdash;by taking
away these golden crowns that have
been the cause of all our misfortunes."</p>

<p>"I will grant your desire," said the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
King; "but in remembrance of your kindness
to me you shall hereafter wear a diadem
of feathers; but bear in mind that
happiness is not in the gift of the great or
the rich, but that it only belongs to those
who earn it."</p>

<p>Thereafter the lapwings were no longer
pursued by man, and they were happier
with their modest tuft of feathers than
they had been with their golden diadem.</p>

<h2>VI<br />
<span class="small">THE ROOSTER, THE CAT, AND THE<br />
REAP-HOOK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="center bold in0 p3t p2b"><i>The Story of the Rooster</i></p>

<p>Once on a time there were three
brothers, who were orphans. The oldest
was called Jack, the second was called
John, and the youngest was known as
Jack-John. Their father was a poor laborer,
who was compelled to get up in the
morning when the roosters crew for daylight,
and he worked all day, and until very
late in the night. He found it a hard
matter to earn his daily bread, and it was
only with a great deal of toil and trouble
that he could provide for his little children.
When the mother was alive they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
manage to make both ends meet, but after
she died it seemed that everything was
changed. The ground was less fertile, and
the rains were less frequent, and the crops
were smaller than they had been. In
short, matters were in such a condition
that the family had fallen into the most abject
want; and to add to all this, during a
very cold winter, their father died, leaving
them alone. As may be supposed, the
children cried and mourned a long time,
but, at last, as is natural with children, they
ceased to grieve. After a while, when all
had ceased to mourn, the oldest said:</p>

<p>"The land has been a curse to us. Let
us divide the inheritance of our father and
go abroad. Perhaps we can make our
fortunes elsewhere."</p>

<p>"What inheritance do you speak of?
What riches have we?" inquired Jack-John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>"I know not, my dear brother," said the
eldest. "Let us make an inventory and
then we will see."</p>

<p>The inventory was made without any
trouble, and, after paying a few just debts
there was nothing left but a cat, a rooster,
and a reap-hook. The brothers thereupon,
in order to be perfectly fair, had to draw
lots. The short straw gave the rooster to
Jack, the cat to John, and the reap-hook
to Jack-John.</p>

<p>Then the three brothers embraced each
other affectionately, and promised to meet
at the old homestead as soon as they had
made their fortune; and each took a different
road.</p>

<p>After travelling a long time in the
plains and on the mountains, always keeping
ahead, Jack, the eldest, reached a
great kingdom belonging to Prince Calamor.
Jack's journey had been a long one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and the sun was disappearing little by
little, and the night coming on rapidly.</p>

<p>"Ah, how tired I am!" exclaimed
Jack. "If I could only find a tavern
where I could rest!"</p>

<p>He had hardly ceased to speak when, at
a turn in the road he saw a beautiful castle,
built on a rock, like an eagle's nest,
and flanked on both sides by twelve
towers.</p>

<p>"This is the very thing," said the tired
traveller, and he announced his arrival by
lifting the heavy knocker of a brass door.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said a voice
from the inside.</p>

<p>"I want a lodging-place," said Jack,
"for myself and my little companion."</p>

<p>"The master of this house," said the
porter, opening the door, "never refuses
hospitality to those who demand shelter.
Come in, and make yourself at home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>When Jack had entered, the friendly
porter inquired:</p>

<p>"My friend, have you dined this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"My faith, no!" exclaimed Jack. "My
wallet is empty, and it has been empty
since morning."</p>

<p>"Come to the table, then," exclaimed
the porter, pushing Jack along the wide
hall-way. "Eat and drink and spare nothing,
for you are the guest of his most powerful
majesty King Calamor."</p>

<p>Jack did not wait for a second invitation.
He hurried to the dining-room and
ate his fill, and his rooster&mdash;the rooster
with the golden feathers&mdash;ate heartily of
the crumbs that fell from the table. As
it was already late, the porter made haste
to prepare a bed for the wayfarer, and
Jack soon fell asleep, with the rooster
perched on the headboard of his bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>It so happened that in that country
those who served King Calamor had to go
and search for Day every morning. They
not only had to search for Day, but they
had to hunt for the place where it could
be found. Jack slept but lightly, and he
heard the conversation of the servants,
who were in the same room.</p>

<p>"Get up!" said one; "it is time for us
to be going. We must be hunting for
Day."</p>

<p>"Wait a little," said the other, "I am
very sleepy."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the first, "we must
make haste, or some one who rises earlier
might seize the Sun and carry it away, and
then the King, our master, would be very
angry."</p>

<p>"Is the wagon ready?" asked another.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the axles are all well greased.
It is early, and the wagon will not break,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
as it did last week, and we will be able to
go much faster."</p>

<p>All this time Jack was thinking to himself
in this wise: "Truly this is a queer
country that the King's people have to go
off to hunt Day." The servants were up
and ready to go, when Jack cried out:</p>

<p>"Friends, get back to bed, and I will
take charge of your work. I will fetch
the Day."</p>

<p>"What! you!" said a servant. "Only
one man! And do you pretend that you
can do what ten horses can hardly accomplish?
You are making game of us."</p>

<p>"I make game of no one. You will
soon see that I mean what I say," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"That seems very queer," said the head-servant.</p>

<p>"Fear not," said Jack, "I will help you
through this by the assistance of my little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
companion&mdash;my rooster with the golden
feathers."</p>

<p>"But, see here!" exclaimed the head-servant,
with an air of sternness, "if you
do not bring Day at the appointed hour,
the King will be without mercy, and you
will be hanged."</p>

<p>"Nay, let me do as I wish," said Jack,
sleepily; "go to bed quietly."</p>

<p>With this assurance the servants and
the carters did not need to be coaxed.
They returned to their beds and slept
heavily. Shortly after, the rooster with
the golden feathers crew.</p>

<p>"What is that?" exclaimed the sleepers
arising from their couches in surprise.</p>

<p>"It is very simple," said one. "Our
friend yonder is about to start on his journey
in search of Day."</p>

<p>"That is very strange!" exclaimed the
others as they fell back in their beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>An hour afterward the rooster crew
again. "<i>Lock-the-Dairy-door! Lock-the-Dairy-door!</i>"</p>

<p>The noise awoke them all.</p>

<p>"What is that?" exclaimed the servants.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Jack. "My little
companion is merely telling me that he
has returned from his journey in search of
the Day. Get up and see."</p>

<p>The servants at once arose, and, to the
astonishment of them all, they saw the Sun
appearing over the mountain-tops more
brilliant than ever. Seeing this there was
at once a contention among the servants
as to which should be the first to carry the
strange news to King Calamor.</p>

<p>"Master! master!" cried one, more
nimble than the rest, "if you only knew!"</p>

<p>"What has happened?" exclaimed the
King; "speak quickly!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>"The horses are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Broken down like the others," the
King interrupted. "Well, it can't be
helped."</p>

<p>"No, no, your Majesty; the horses are
still in their stalls, and the wagons have
not been out of the stables. But, get up
and look! Get up and admire the Day."</p>

<p>"Ah, you rascals! Do you make game
of me? Did Day come by itself to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday, your Majesty," said the servant,
"a stranger came and asked for lodging
for himself and a queer creature with
golden feathers. It carries a bunch of
feathers in its tail and a tuft of feathers
on its head."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, what did he do?" said King
Calamor.</p>

<p>"What has he done? What has he
done?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the King, "answer me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," said the servant, "this
insignificant creature, that seems as if it
could be crushed by a blow of the hand,
is stronger than all your horses put together.
Without wagons or assistance of
any kind it started out, about two hours
ago, and has already returned, bringing
the Sun."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe such a miracle!" exclaimed
the King.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is the truth," said the
servant. "What fatigue and trouble this
creature would save us!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the King, "how many
horses and wagons would I not save! But
what you say does not seem credible."</p>

<p>"Nothing can be truer," insisted the
servant, "and you can easily satisfy yourself."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" inquired the King.</p>

<p>"Well," said the servant, "tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
stranger and his companion to remain in
the castle, and by watching with us to-night
you can be convinced."</p>

<p>"Tell him to stay," said the King. "I
am anxious to witness this queer phenomenon."</p>

<p>These directions were followed, and to
the King who was waiting, the day seemed
long indeed. Never had he been so impatient.
When night came he went to
bed in the granary with the servants.</p>

<p>"Do not be uneasy," said Jack; "I shall
take charge of these matters again to-morrow,"
and everybody went to sleep with
the exception of the King, who could not
close his eyes, he was so impatient.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning the
rooster crew, "<i>Lock-the-Dairy-door!</i>"</p>

<p>"Who is that?" exclaimed the King.
"Who talks in that language?"</p>

<p>"It is my little companion, the rooster,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
said Jack. "He is preparing to go into
the country in search of Day."</p>

<p>The King lay quiet. At four o'clock
he heard again the sonorous voice of the
strange creature with the golden feathers.</p>

<p>"Hey, my friend!" the King cried,
"what is that?"</p>

<p>"It is the rooster who has returned,"
said Jack. "His expedition has been a
prosperous one, as you can see. He has
brought Day with him, and already the
light of it is shining on the mountain-tops
and filling the valleys. Rise, your Majesty,
and see for yourself."</p>

<p>At these words the King arose and ran
to the window. The stranger had spoken
the truth. Day&mdash;clear, joyous, and resplendent&mdash;shone
over the land. Bewildered
and confused, the King could hardly
recover from his astonishment. What
would he not give to possess such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
enchanted rooster! And if he possessed
him, how jealous and envious of his good
fortune the neighboring kings would be!
Without loss of time the King said to
Jack:</p>

<p>"My friend, your companion pleases me
much, and he can be of great service to
me. Will you sell him?"</p>

<p>"Sell him!" exclaimed Jack. "By no
means! I would not sell him for gold
and silver."</p>

<p>"Let us see," said the King, "for a hundred
crown pieces?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, sturdily, "not for a
thousand."</p>

<p>"By my kingdom!" said the ruler,
"you are hard to please. What price
have you set on him?"</p>

<p>"In exchange for my companion," said
Jack, "I want you to give me your most
beautiful daughter for a wife."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" cried the King, "for no
less?"</p>

<p>"For no less," said Jack.</p>

<p>"So be it," said the King. "I give
you my youngest daughter, and a hundred
thousand gold crown pieces for her
dowry."</p>

<p>In a transport of joy Jack threw himself
on the King's neck, and the marriage
was celebrated at once, in the midst of
pomp becoming so great a princess.</p>

<p>From that time the good King Calamor
had no occasion to send his servants
and his horses for the Day.</p>


<p class="center bold in0 p3t p2b"><i>The Story of the Cat</i></p>

<p>We have seen how Jack made his fortune.
Now let us see what became of his
brother John, the possessor of the cat.
We shall soon know whether he wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
over the earth in misery and misfortune.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the lot that had befallen
him, the poor fellow went on his way
singing and whistling, feeling no uneasiness
as to his destination. He paused
only to drink the sparkling waters, or to
eat the luscious fruit that had been ripened
by the golden sun. He travelled thus for
many miles, until one day he found himself
in the country where the birds speak
the language of men&mdash;the country of the
Murzipouloums, where the flowers sing
songs to themselves, and the cattle fly in
the air. He was astonished by these
things, but presently he came to a village
where a new and a more astonishing spectacle
presented itself to his sight. More
than a hundred people were abroad in the
streets, armed with sticks, chasing rats and
mice that seemed to laugh at them. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
the sight of this new and peculiar war,
John could not keep his countenance. He
laughed aloud. At this unseemly display
of jollity the people on all sides cried
out:</p>

<p>"What in the world are you laughing
at?" Some were furious and some were
curious.</p>

<p>"I laugh, my poor friends," said John,
"because you give yourselves so much
trouble for so small a thing."</p>

<p>"So small a thing!" they cried&mdash;"a
small thing! One can tell you are a
stranger here, otherwise you would know
that the rats and the mice are our most
terrible enemies. It would be an easier
matter for us to contend with ten thousand
men."</p>

<p>"Now, is this true?" exclaimed John.
"Well, here is my little companion who
will aid you greatly. In one hour's time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
he will do more of this kind of work than
all the rest of you could do in a year."</p>

<p>The people gathered around, admiring
the little creature with gray eyes. It
seemed to be very mild.</p>

<p>"Young man," cried they, "do you
wish to have a laugh at our expense?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourselves," said John,
and with that he turned the cat loose
among the rats and mice. You may be
sure the cat was very happy. A leap here,
a bound there, a jump yonder&mdash;to the
right and to the left, before and behind&mdash;and
the rats and the mice were destroyed
by hundreds and by thousands. The people
marvelled greatly, the more so since
the cat had accomplished in a very short
time a work that would have required the
aid of an army of rat-killers.</p>

<p>While this work was going on, the
Prince of the country happened to be passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
by. He saw the work the cat had accomplished,
and cried out:</p>

<p>"Hey, my friends! Where did you find
such a creature as that? Where did you
discover such a warrior?"</p>

<p>Thereupon John advanced politely, and
said to the Prince:</p>

<p>"The creature which you see so cleverly
amusing itself with the mice is called a
cat. It is my faithful friend, and since it
came into my possession I have never
permitted it to leave me."</p>

<p>"My young friend," said the Prince,
"you have there a fine fortune. My castle
is infested with rats and mice; sell me
your companion, and you shall be well
paid."</p>

<p>"Be separated from my best friend!"
exclaimed John. "Never, never will I do
that."</p>

<p>"Let us see," said the Prince; "will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
you not sell me your companion for a
hundred crown pieces?"</p>

<p>"No," cried John; "I would die of
grief."</p>

<p>"I will give you a thousand then," said
the Prince.</p>

<p>"Never," said John, stoutly.</p>

<p>"My friend," exclaimed the Prince, "be
reasonable. I must have your cat. Name
the price."</p>

<p>John scratched his head thoughtfully,
and replied:</p>

<p>"Well, give me a meadow and a mill,
a vineyard and a thousand crown-pieces,
and a carriage to ride in."</p>

<p>"They shall be yours," said the Prince.</p>

<p>"Then," said John, "my beautiful cat
is yours."</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p3t p2b"><i>The Story of the Reap-hook</i></p>

<p>We have thus far followed the history
of Jack, with his rooster, and John, with
his cat. What became of Jack-John, the
younger brother, with his reap-hook?</p>

<p>Journeying over hills and across valleys,
with his reap-hook hung over his shoulder,
stopping only to eat and to drink, the
younger brother, at the end of thirty days
and thirty nights, arrived in the great
empire of Malissours. It was in the
month of July, and the fields were yellow
with the golden grain, which waved lightly
in the wind. For the first time since he
left home, Jack-John felt tired; his limbs
refused to carry him farther. How happy
he would be, he thought, if he could only
reach the village near by, where there was
an orange-grove. But his efforts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
useless, and the young fellow lay down in
the shadow of a big oak, and was soon fast
asleep.</p>

<p>How long he remained there he did not
know; but when Jack-John awoke, it was
morning, and he was surrounded by a
crowd of people who eyed him curiously
without daring to approach.</p>

<p>"Hey, friends!" he cried, "I am ravenously
hungry. Have you nothing to offer
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," was the reply on all sides,
"but on one condition."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked Jack-John.</p>

<p>"You must tell us what the half-moon
in a handle, which you have sleeping beside
you, is for."</p>

<p>"The half-moon that sleeps?" exclaimed
Jack-John in surprise. "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Your companion that sleeps beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
you on the green moss," said the people.</p>

<p>"You make me laugh," said Jack-John.
"It is not my companion&mdash;it is not an animal.
It is simply a reap-hook."</p>

<p>"A reap-hook," exclaimed the people.
"What a strange name! Never before
have we seen such a thing."</p>

<p>Jack-John was astonished, but in a moment
he thought that the time had arrived
for him to make his fortune; so he said:</p>

<p>"I see that your grain is ripe. It is
time to harvest it. How do you cut
it?"</p>

<p>"Like everybody else," said they, "we
gnaw it with the teeth."</p>

<p>"That must be tedious," said Jack-John.</p>

<p>"Oh, there are hundreds of us to do
the work," said the people.</p>

<p>"And how long does it take you to
complete the task?" asked Jack-John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>"Two or three months only," the people
replied.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" said Jack-John, "what it
takes all of you three months to accomplish
my good reap-hook will do in one
hour's time. A thousand of you working
together could not make as much headway.
Under its magic touch the grain falls and
you have only to bind it."</p>

<p>"What!" they exclaimed, "that little
instrument does all the work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Jack-John, "and if
you desire it, I will prove it to you instantly."</p>

<p>Thereupon Jack-John made his way to
the fields of ripe golden grain, and in a
few minutes had cut quantities of it. The
spectators were full of admiration. Never
had they seen anything so extraordinary;
and to these people it was indeed a most
marvellous thing for them to see accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
in a minute the work that would
require the efforts of a hundred men from
sunrise to sunset. On all sides there were
shouts of joy and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh, the beautiful machine you have
there!" the people cried&mdash;"the fairy that
runs and cuts the grain. What a treasure
to him who possesses it!"</p>

<p>"I see that my beautiful reap-hook
pleases you," said Jack-John. "How much
are you willing to pay for it?"</p>

<p>"All the gold in the world would not
be sufficient to pay you," said the spokesman
of the people. "Name your price."</p>

<p>"I want each one of you to give me as
many gold-pieces as my reap-hook has cut
stalks of wheat."</p>

<p>"Your demand is modest," they answered,
"and to-day each one of us will
bring the required sum."</p>

<p>After this Jack-John was lifted on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
shoulders of the multitude and carried to
the neighboring village, where he was
treated with great honor, and for a little
more he could have become king. Soon,
on all sides, the people brought sacks of
gold, and such was its weight that ten
mules were required to carry it. Jack-John,
however, did not stay very long in this empire.
He rightly thought that no country
is so beautiful as one's birthplace, and, at
the end of a few weeks, he arrived at his
native village, where he found his two
brothers, who had been as successful.</p>

<p>"Our good fortune," exclaimed the eldest,
"has made us rich, and now it ought
to make us happy."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>VII<br />
<span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A rich lord, who was at the same time
the best of men, wishing to contribute to
the happiness of one of his slaves, set him
free. He equipped a vessel with a white
prow and a golden stern, and said to his
old servant:</p>

<p>"Go out into the world, navigate the
seas, and choose a country that will please
you, and always remember to do what
good you can on the way, and remember
also to avoid evil."</p>

<p>The grateful slave set sail, but he had
journeyed only a few hours when a terrible
tempest arose, and it was so violent as
to throw him on an island that seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
be deserted. The unfortunate man had
lost his vessel and all his merchandise, and
he was the victim of despair. When he
landed on the island, the sole survivor of
his expedition, he gave himself up to grief,
and went forward friendless, alone, and in
the direst poverty, not knowing where to
direct his steps. But he was soon to be
made supremely happy, for he discovered
a path that was scarcely perceptible. He
followed it with eagerness, and soon arrived
at the top of a high mountain, from
which he could see a great city.</p>

<p>He made haste to go in that direction,
but what was his astonishment when,
on approaching the city, he found himself
surrounded by a great concourse of
people, crying out in transports of joy.
The drums beat loudly and the trumpets
sounded, and on all sides the heralds exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<p>"Men! here is your monarch!"</p>

<p>At last the slave and his cavalcade arrived
in the city, and with great pomp he
was installed in a marvellous palace, where
the kings of the country had lived. The
fortunate slave was taken in charge by the
servants of the palace, and robed in fine
purple garments, and his head was crowned
with a diadem. Then the principal lords
of the realm, in the name of the people,
swore allegiance to him and the obedience
and fidelity due unto sovereigns. The
happy monarch for a long time believed
that he was dreaming. His good fortune
seemed to him to be a whim&mdash;the result of
circumstance.</p>

<p>However, after a long time he realized
the full measure of his responsibility, and
thought to himself&mdash;"What does all this
signify? What does Providence wish me
to do? This worried him night and day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and finally he sent for the wisest lord in
his kingdom.</p>

<p>"Vizier," he asked, "who made me
your King? Why do the people obey
me? And what is to become of me?"</p>

<p>"You must know, great King," responded
the minister, "that the genii who
inhabit this island have asked the good
Lord to send them each year a child of
Adam to reign over them. These vows
the great Being has deigned to answer,
and every year, on the same day, a man
lands on our coast. At such time the
people are filled with transports of joy;
they meet him with loud acclaim, as they
met you, and crown him King; but the
extent of his reign can only be for one
year. When the twelve months are out,
the King, who has been so powerful is
stripped of his honors, clothed in coarse
garments, and his soldiers, unmercifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
pursuing a custom, seize and convey him
on board a black ship, which carries him
away to a deserted island, which has been
rendered sterile by the winds and waves.
He that was only a few days before a rich
and powerful monarch, now finds himself
without subjects, friends, or consolers.
Thereafter he lives a sorrowful life, and
the people who have obeyed his will forget
even his name."</p>

<p>"Were my predecessors," said the King
to his minister, "advised of the fate that
awaited them?"</p>

<p>"None of them were ignorant of it,"
the minister replied; "but they lacked the
courage and the thoughtfulness to contemplate
such a future. They were dazzled
by the pomp and grandeur of their position;
and, in their eagerness for passing
pleasures they refused to contemplate the
sad end that awaited them. The year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
their prosperity and power passed away
almost before they knew it, and when the
fatal day came they had done nothing to
render their inevitable fate less insupportable."</p>

<p>At these words from his minister the
King was filled with fear. He thought
with terror of the precious time that had
already passed, and with tears in his eyes
he said:</p>

<p>"Wise friend! you have announced to
me the misfortunes that are in store for
me; who but you can tell me how to provide
a remedy?"</p>

<p>"Remember, your Majesty," said the
minister, "that naked and in poverty you
came upon this island, and naked and in
poverty you must leave it. There is but
one way for you to avoid the misfortunes
that threaten you. You must send to the
island to which you are to be exiled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
number of workmen and order them to
construct vast storehouses and fill them
with such provisions as seem to you necessary
for sustaining life. You must prepare
for the inevitable. Go quickly to work, for
time presses. Time is approaching, time
is passing away, and you must remember
that you will only find at the place of exile
the treasures you will be able to send there
during the remaining few days of your
reign."</p>

<p>The King thanked his minister, and
resolved to follow the wise man's advice.
Workmen of experience were despatched
to the Island of Exile, and it was not long
before a vast palace was built. The King
conveyed an abundance of treasure there,
and a thousand men were sent to render
the island more inhabitable.</p>

<p>The day came when the King was to
leave his throne; but, far from regretting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
it, he sighed for the hour when he would
be able to take possession of his new estates.
He was banished from the throne,
divested of his royal robes, and sent on
board a ship that conveyed him to the
Island of Exile.</p>

<p>Having provided himself a place of
refuge, he lived long and happily there.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>VIII<br />
<span class="small">BROTHER TIGER AND DADDY<br />
SHEEP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During the time when the animals
could talk, Daddy Sheep was the terror of
all the plains and the woods. When he
walked abroad, with his sharp horns hanging
on his head, the creatures that met
him saluted him with the utmost politeness,
and then ran away, glad to escape
with their lives. In order for Daddy Sheep
to have such a reputation as this, it would
seem to be necessary that he had made a
great many victims, devouring some with
his teeth, and tearing others with his terrible
horns; but in regard to these matters
I am not able to testify. I am of
the opinion, moreover, that old Mammy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Sheep, who knew him well, could not say
any more. She and her friends, and, indeed,
all the other animals, justified the
proverb that is applied to those who are
lazy and cowardly: "It is better to believe
what you hear than to go and investigate
the matter." As often happens, the
repetition of a statement gives it currency,
and all the creatures came to believe that
Daddy Sheep was as terrible as rumor had
described him to be.</p>

<p>One day, as Daddy Sheep was going
out of the pasture, where he had been
grazing on wild thyme, he came to a beautiful
river and concluded to quench his
thirst. He approached the water, and
started to drink, but the terrible reflection
he saw there&mdash;a frowning face surrounded
by wrinkled horns frightened him to such
a degree that he scampered home as fast
as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>One day a Tiger, who lived not far from
this so-called king of the forest and plain,
mustered up courage, and resolved to cultivate
the good-will of his powerful neighbor
by making him a visit. So he took
with him his son, the young Tiger, who
was already well grown. While yet at
a distance the Tiger saw the powerful
Sheep, and saluted him very humbly.
Coming nearer, the Tiger, still humble
and polite, inquired after the health of
Daddy Sheep's family.</p>

<p>"I came, dear neighbor," said Brother
Tiger, "to pay you a visit of respect. My
good wife would have come also, but she
is unavoidably detained at home expecting
a visit from a friend, and she is compelled
to postpone this pleasure to another day."</p>

<p>"Come in, neighbor&mdash;come in!" exclaimed
Daddy Sheep. "To whom does
this charming child belong?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>"It is my child," said Brother Tiger.</p>

<p>"Then you must accept my sincere congratulations,"
said Daddy Sheep.</p>

<p>"And your own son?" exclaimed
Brother Tiger, with effusive politeness;
"how is he?"</p>

<p>"He is very well, I thank you," said
Daddy Sheep, "he is in the house."</p>

<p>While the two fathers were gravely discussing
the affairs of the country, the
young Tiger and the young Sheep went
out into the garden to play. After a
while, Brother Tiger became so uneasy
that he could scarcely keep still.</p>

<p>"Excuse me a moment," he said to
Daddy Sheep, "I will return directly."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly!" exclaimed Daddy
Sheep. "Do not stand on ceremony
here."</p>

<p>At once Brother Tiger went out and
whispered to his son:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"Be careful, my child! You must be
very polite with the little Sheep, and do
not get angry, or he will eat you up."</p>

<p>The Tiger went back to the house, and
the two young friends returned to their
play. Soon the young Tiger forgot the
counsel of his father, and, during their
frolic, he jumped on the little Sheep and
tickled him. This made the little Sheep
laugh and show his teeth.</p>

<p>"Why, what small teeth you have!"
cried the little Tiger.</p>

<p>"They are all like that in my family,"
said the little Sheep, "and those of my father
are not any longer."</p>

<p>This set the little Tiger to thinking, and
as soon as the visit was ended he exclaimed,
almost before Daddy Sheep's
door was shut:</p>

<p>"Pappy, pappy! did you see the little
Sheep's teeth? They are very short, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
he says that those of all his family are no
longer than his."</p>

<p>"Hush!" exclaimed Brother Tiger.
"Speak low, you little rascal, or Daddy
Sheep will hear you and eat us both."</p>

<p>Brother Tiger, however, who had a
mind of his own, thought that there might
be something in what his son had said, and
the idea gave him pleasure. Daddy Sheep
was so fat, and his flesh must therefore be
so delicate and tender. For a long time
the suggestion of the little Tiger worried
Brother Tiger, and he was absorbed in
deep thought. Finally, one day, he mustered
up all his courage, and declared
that he would taste the flesh of Daddy
Sheep.</p>

<p>But, he thought to himself, how could
he see Daddy Sheep's teeth? At last the
opportunity presented itself, for Daddy
Sheep and his son paid Brother Tiger a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
visit Brother Tiger received Daddy
Sheep with the greatest politeness, and
saluted him. He invited Daddy Sheep
into his house, and begged him to make
himself at home. For the refreshment of
his guests Brother Tiger set out wine.
The little Sheep drank some and went out
to play; but Daddy Sheep, who was very
fond of his glass, remained inside.</p>

<p>"How do you like my wine, neighbor?"
asked Brother Tiger.</p>

<p>"It is most excellent!" exclaimed
Daddy Sheep, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Then have another glass," said Brother
Tiger.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Daddy Sheep; "I
thank you and drink to your health."
Then he laughed loudly and said: "The
weather is warm, and it is not out of
place to take a glass of wine to arouse
one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>"That is true," said Brother Tiger, "my
wine cleans the cobwebs from the throat
and clarifies the brain."</p>

<p>They drank together many times, but, in
spite of all, Brother Tiger was unable to
see Daddy Sheep's teeth. He talked softly
and modestly, and minced his words in a
surprising way, as you have seen a young
girl do. But Brother Tiger did not despair;
he determined to accomplish his
object, and so he again called attention to
the wine.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Daddy Sheep!" he exclaimed;
"I believe you are asleep.
Arouse yourself and help me to finish this
bottle."</p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks!" said Daddy Sheep,
"but I am not thirsty."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, neighbor," said Brother Tiger,
"that is not the way to talk. Thirst is
only for the gnomes and the sprites who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
seek the dew. As for us, the kings of
this country, we must drink to divert ourselves."</p>

<p>Feeling himself flattered and enjoying
it, Daddy Sheep extended his glass. It
was promptly filled and he emptied it. It
was as promptly filled once more, and he
emptied it again.</p>

<p>"Here's to your health," said Brother
Tiger.</p>

<p>"And to yours, my dear host," said
Daddy Sheep, and he again emptied his
glass at one gulp.</p>

<p>The more Daddy Sheep drank the gayer
he became, and the louder he talked. He
lost his customary reserve, but he had not
yet condescended to laugh. Brother Tiger,
however, continued to press wine on his
guest, and it finally came to pass that
Daddy Sheep sat back in his chair, and
laughed in the foolish way common to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
those whose brains are befuddled by the
fumes of liquor.</p>

<p>Brother Tiger saw the short teeth of his
guest, and, without hesitating a moment,
he leaped on Daddy Sheep and strangled
him. Hearing the loud outcry made by
his father, the little Sheep ran as quickly
as he could to his mother.</p>

<p>"The wicked Tiger," he exclaimed, as
he ran home, "has killed my father, and
has no doubt devoured him!"</p>

<p>At these terrible words the Mother
Sheep almost fainted with fright, and her
grief was pitiful to behold. The little
Sheep joined his mother in her wailings,
and the mournful noise they made attracted
the attention of the Queen of
the Birds, who came out of the forest
and perched herself on a tree near their
house.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, good Sheep?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
asked, "and what is the cause of your
grief?"</p>

<p>"Alas, alas! Brother Tiger has devoured
my poor husband!"</p>

<p>"Ah, the infamous villain!" exclaimed
the Queen of the Birds.</p>

<p>"We will not dare to venture out any
more," continued the Mother Sheep.
"The vile assassin will hide around here
and try to devour us also."</p>

<p>Touched by the tears of the Mother
Sheep and her son, the Queen of the Birds
tried to console them the best she could,
and promised them that they should be
revenged, and in a moment she had flown
away to the neighboring forests. She
gave utterance to her well-known cry&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Pingle, pingle!</div>
<div class="i0">Dingle, dingle!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="in0">and in a very short time her faithful subjects
could be seen coming from all sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
birds of high and low degree, of bright
plumage and dull&mdash;the red-breast and the
white-cap, the bald eagle and the green
parrots. The Queen of the Birds uttered
her musical call again&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Pingle, pingle!</div>
<div class="i0">Dingle, dingle!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="in0">And then all the smaller birds that had
wandered off into the woods flew to her
side, and begged to know what her wishes
were. Their Queen then related to them
the murder of Daddy Sheep by the hypocritical
and cruel Brother Tiger. Her
story was full of emotion and good feeling,
and she concluded by saying:</p>

<p>"This assassin, my faithful friends, must
die in his turn. Such a monster should
not be permitted to live on earth."</p>

<p>All the birds applauded with their wings
at these words of the Queen, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
could not help congratulating their sovereign.</p>

<p>"Go, my friends and subjects," said the
Queen, "into the far countries, and say to
the birds who have not heard my call, that
I am about to give a grand ball, and that
I will await them to-morrow. Meanwhile
I will go myself and invite Brother Tiger,
who cannot refuse to assist at the feast."</p>

<p>"But how will you kill this odious monster?"
inquired the great eagle.</p>

<p>"Have confidence, my friend. Am I
not the Queen? To-morrow you will be
satisfied. While you wait, aid in preparing
everything for the feast."</p>

<p>Singing, whistling, and screaming, all
the birds began to work. The brambles
were removed, the stones thrown away,
and the grass alone, green and tender, was
left in the space they had chosen for the
ball. The next day the Queen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Birds was arrayed in the most beautiful
dress imaginable. Escorted by her pages,
she went to the house of Brother Tiger.
Flattered by the visit of the Queen of
the Birds, he vowed that he would go to
the grand ball in the forest.</p>

<p>"I promise you a dance," said the
Queen, smiling.</p>

<p>"Beautiful Queen," exclaimed Brother
Tiger, "all the honor will be mine."</p>

<p>He could not sleep that night&mdash;not that
he suffered from remorse for his crime, but
because he was carried away by the graciousness
of the great Queen of the Birds.
The next morning Brother Tiger brushed
his clothes, curled his mustache, and went
to the spot where the grand ball was to
be given. As soon as it was seen that he
was coming, the Queen of the Birds exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Take your places for a quadrille, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
let all dance with their heads under their
wings. Music, play! trumpets, sound!
and you, drums, beat! Whereupon, the
orchestra began to play one of its most
delightful airs for the dance:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Tumpy, tumpy, tum-tum!</div>
<div class="i2">Tum-tum, tum-tum!</div>
<div class="i0">Tumpy, tumpy, tum-tum!</div>
<div class="i2">Tum-tum ti!"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Then the Queen of the Birds flew and met
Brother Tiger, and made him welcome.</p>

<p>"My dear friend, you are late!" she exclaimed.
"The festivities have already
begun."</p>

<p>"I trust your majesty will excuse me,"
said Brother Tiger, "my clock stopped
during the night."</p>

<p>"That is nothing," said the Queen;
"come!"</p>

<p>Oh, what a delicious feast! what fine
music! Brother Tiger was dazzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"My Queen!" he exclaimed, "I am
glad you thought of me. A ball like this
at your court is a rare occurrence."</p>

<p>Long rows of birds stood facing each
other, and birds of all degrees danced together.</p>

<p>After the quadrille the orchestra struck
up a waltz, and the Queen courteously
said to her guest:</p>

<p>"This time you shall be my partner!"</p>

<p>Filled with pride the Tiger took his
place by the side of the beautiful Queen
of the Birds. Then the birds, all with
their heads under their wings began to
dance. Brother Tiger wanted to join in
the first steps of the dance, but all of a
sudden the Queen of the Birds called out
to him:</p>

<p>"Brother Tiger! really you are not
thinking! The etiquette of my court is
that the invited guest, in order to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
part in the dance, should appear without a
head. Look around you. All here would
think themselves guilty of the most unpardonable
rudeness if they dared to raise
their eyes in the presence of their sovereign.
The simplest rules of politeness require
that you should follow their example.
Do as they are doing, if you desire
to dance with the Queen of the Birds."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," exclaimed Brother
Tiger, blushing violently, "I had no intention
of wounding you, and I humbly
beg you to pardon my ignorance. I am
merely a poor country person who is used
to spending his days and nights in quiet
places, and I am unused to the ways and
customs of the court. Promise me another
dance, I beg you, and I will return
immediately."</p>

<p>"I never had any ill-will against you,
Brother Tiger," said the Queen of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Birds. "One cannot know everything.
Go! I await you!"</p>

<p>Brother Tiger rushed to his home, and
in a very short time he arrived.</p>

<p>"Wife, wife!" he exclaimed, "get an
axe. In order to have the honor of dancing
with the great Queen of the Birds, one
must appear before her without a head."</p>

<p>"My poor husband," said Mrs. Tiger,
"I really believe you are losing your mind
or that you are making fun of me."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Brother Tiger, "it is
the etiquette of the court. All the other
guests were dancing without heads. Get
the axe, wife! The Queen awaits me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiger did not want to obey; but
when she saw that her angry husband was
disposed to show his sharp claws, she took
the sharp axe and cut off his head with
one blow. It is needless to say that
Brother Tiger expired instantly. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
good news was carried to the Queen of the
Birds by two green paroquets, and when
the announcement was made the birds
took their heads from under their wings.
All the other animals in the forest were
invited to the feast, and Mother Sheep
and her son were special guests. They
were still in mourning, and therefore did
not take part in the dance, but they received
special attention and consideration
on all sides, and the wonderful orchestra
kept up its playing.</p>

<p>Now, big sheep and little children, let
me whisper something in your ears: It is
better not to open your mouths at all than
to be too familiar with people you do not
know well.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>IX<br />
<span class="small">"JUMP IN MY SACK!"</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a barren and an unproductive country
there lived, a long time ago, a father
and his twelve children. A terrible famine
came on the country, and the unfortunate
father said to his sons:</p>

<p>"My children, I have nothing whatever
to give you. Go out into the world, knock
at each door, ask for work, and perhaps
you will find the means of making your
living."</p>

<p>At these words the youngest of the
twelve brothers, Abdallah, began to cry,
and said:</p>

<p>"I am crippled, and it is difficult for me
to walk. How can I gain my livelihood?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Dry your tears," said the father;
"your brothers will take you along with
them. They have good hearts, and if fortune
smiles on them you may be sure that
you will not be forgotten."</p>

<p>Early next morning the twelve brothers
started out, after having faithfully promised
their father that they would never be separated.
But the deceitful brothers did not
mean what they said. After several days
of travel the eldest said to the others:</p>

<p>"Our little brother Abdallah is a continual
burden. He delays our journey day
by day, and if he continues to do so we
will never get out of this miserable country.
Let us forsake him on the way and
perhaps some charitable person will find
and take pity on him."</p>

<p>This advice was followed by the brothers.
The little cripple was deserted by the
way-side, and the other brothers continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
on their way, begging from every one they
met. In this way they went on until they
came to a settlement of poor fishermen,
where it was difficult to find a lodging-place.
Fortunately for them the night
was beautiful, the moon shone brilliantly
in the sky, and a soft breeze tempered
the heat that had filled the atmosphere
during the day.</p>

<p>Overcome with fatigue the eleven brothers
stretched themselves out at the foot of
a tree, and they were soon sound asleep.
After a while the dawn made its appearance,
the brothers awoke, and the eldest
said:</p>

<p>"For days and weeks we have been
travelling without meeting with the good
fortune we had hoped for. Let us leave
this country for good and all. Only a
strip of water lies between us and a land of
plenty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>The unfortunate brothers soon saw an
empty sloop. They took possession of it,
and at once began to drift out to sea. It
was an unfortunate voyage. All the hopes
of the brothers were deceptive. Their
cruelty to their crippled brother Abdallah
was to be severely punished. A frightful
tempest arose, and the sea overwhelmed
them; the sloop was wrecked and the
cruel brothers found their graves in the
cold and creeping waters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile what had become of Abdallah,
the poor cripple whom the brothers
had deserted? Overwhelmed with sorrow
and fatigue, he had fallen asleep where he
had been abandoned. Fortunately for him
a good fairy, who had seen all, took pity
on him, and while he lay asleep she cured
his crippled leg; and then, disguising herself
as a poor beggar, the fairy sat on a
stone by the roadside. Abdallah soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
opened his eyes, his heart filled with sadness.
He arose for the purpose of continuing
his painful journey, but what was his
astonishment to find that he could walk
without any trouble whatever. He was no
longer a cripple. He felt of himself, and
ran and jumped to convince himself that
he was not dreaming. He laughed and
cried at the same time, and was filled with
happiness and joy.</p>

<p>All of a sudden he saw an old woman
by the roadside who looked at him smilingly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, madam," he cried, "if
a great physician has passed this way?"</p>

<p>"And why, my friend?" inquired the
old woman.</p>

<p>"It is because that, during my sleep, he
has rendered me the greatest of services.
He has cured my leg that was too short,
and I want to thank him for his kindness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well," said the old woman, "the
physician is myself. I gathered a few
herbs that I alone know, and it was easy
to perform the miracle that makes you so
happy."</p>

<p>Abdallah could not restrain his transports.
He fell on the old woman's neck
and embraced her, and then, to prove his
gratitude, he asked her:</p>

<p>"My good woman, what can I do for
you? I am young, but, as for you, age
has already begun to bear heavily on you.
Command, and I will obey you in all
things."</p>

<p>But imagine Abdallah's surprise when,
instead of the old woman, he saw before
him the most charming young girl that it
is possible to imagine. Her long blond
hair floated on her shoulders, and her rich
garments fell in gracious folds around her.</p>

<p>Overcome with admiration and respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Abdallah fell on his knees in the dust;
but the good fairy said to him:</p>

<p>"Arise! I am happy to see that you are
not ungrateful. Make two wishes, and
they will be immediately granted, for I am
the queen of the fairies."</p>

<p>The young man reflected a moment and
said:</p>

<p>"I desire above all things a bag in
which everything I want will be found in
an instant."</p>

<p>"Your demand is certainly original,"
said the fairy, smiling. "What can you do
with such a sack?"</p>

<p>"A great many things," exclaimed the
young man, enthusiastically; "will you
grant my request?"</p>

<p>"So be it," said the fairy; "and what is
your second wish?"</p>

<p>"A stick that will do my bidding."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," and the fairy disappeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
leaving at Abdallah's feet a sack
and a stick.</p>

<p>Overcome and delighted by his good
fortune, the young man hastened to test
the powers that had been conferred on
him by these gifts. As he was feeling
very hungry Abdallah said:</p>

<p>"Let a dozen roasted partridges get
into my sack," and in an instant he found
a dozen well-cooked partridges in his
sack.</p>

<p>To eat without drinking was a very unusual
thing in that country, so, presently,
Abdallah cried out:</p>

<p>"A bottle of wine in my sack!"</p>

<p>Immediately his commands were obeyed.
After his meal he felt as light as a bird,
and he continued on his journey in good
spirits, and the next day he reached the
end of it. At the gate of the city he
paused to rest and to gaze at the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
who were continually passing, when a beggar
approached him and said:</p>

<p>"Brother, we are poor; let us unite our
misfortunes and live together."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, my friend?"
said Abdallah; "I do not solicit alms in
order to stay here."</p>

<p>"Your ragged clothes and your bare
feet, my brother, tell a very different tale."</p>

<p>"That is true," thought the young man,
and he immediately asked his sack to furnish
him with two magnificent suits, such
as were worn by the noblemen of that
country. He gave one to the unfortunate
beggar at his side and clad himself in the
other, and the two went into the city resplendent
with gold and precious stones, so
that everyone thought that two rich and
powerful noblemen had come into the city.</p>

<p>Soon the name of Abdallah was on
everybody's tongue, and the most brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
people of the city considered it an honor
to call themselves his friends.</p>

<p>In that city Abdallah found an Evil
Spirit, which presented itself to him one
day and said:</p>

<p>"Magnanimous chief, the most respectful
of your admirers is here before you."</p>

<p>"What do you desire?" inquired Abdallah.</p>

<p>"I want nothing," said the Evil Spirit,
"but your reputation at the games is such
that I desired to see you."</p>

<p>"You flatter me a great deal," said Abdallah;
"but, really, I cannot play. The
game is entirely unknown to me. However,"
he went on to say, "I desire to make
one of your party in the hope that you
will teach me something about the games."</p>

<p>The Evil Spirit and Abdallah made no
delay in beginning the game, and the latter
lost such large sums of money that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Evil Spirit thought that the young man
was ruined. Contented with himself and
satisfied with the results of his journey, he
was making ready to depart, when Abdallah
saw the cloven foot that the Evil Spirit
had not been able to disguise.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" exclaimed Abdallah to himself.
"It is with the Evil One I have been
playing. So much the better! I will
show him that he made a mistake when he
addressed himself to me." Satisfied with
his discovery, the fortunate possessor of
the sack and the wonderful stick was content
to wait until the next day.</p>

<p>Faithful to the engagement that had
been made, the young man found himself
on the morrow face to face with the Evil
One. The game began, Abdallah lost
many gold pieces, and still he continued
to lose. This time the Evil Spirit won
so rapidly and so continuously that he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Abdallah was reduced to misery.
Addressing himself to the young man, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Illustrious lord, the games of these
last two days must have made a considerable
hole in your fortunes. Through me,
however, you can recover a good part of
it; but on one condition only."</p>

<p>"What condition is that?" inquired
Abdallah.</p>

<p>"Let us understand each other. Let us
become partners, and thus we can win all
the money that the other players have."</p>

<p>But Abdallah would not permit the
Evil Spirit to conclude his proposition.</p>

<p>"Satan!" cried he, "your elegant disguise
has not prevented me from recognizing
you, and your cloven foot has betrayed
you. The gold you have taken from me
is nothing to that which I still possess.
Had you won all the money in the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
I would not be less rich. However, the
day has arrived when you must expiate all
your vile crimes. The hour has struck!"</p>

<p>At these unexpected words the Evil
One took on a sinister aspect, and with a
frightful laugh he began to mock Abdallah.
At this exhibition Abdallah exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Jump into my sack!" and the Old
Boy danced into the bag. "Stick! beat
on him!" cried the young man, and the
stick began to beat on him in fine style, so
much so that the Evil One yelled:</p>

<p>"Stop, or I will be dead! Let me
out!"</p>

<p>"What a delightful misfortune this
would be!" exclaimed Abdallah. "Are
you not content with matters as they
are?"</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing among the
people who were gathered there. At last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
after the stick had been beating the Evil
One for two hours, Abdallah said:</p>

<p>"Enough! that is sufficient for to-day."</p>

<p>"What!" said the Evil One, "is not
that enough? Is the trouble not yet finished?
Am I to have my bones broken
another time?"</p>

<p>"Another time and always," said Abdallah.
"I want you to perish, so that you
will not continue to cut up your capers."</p>

<p>There was some further parley between
Abdallah and the Evil One, which resulted
in returning many unfortunate young
people to their homes&mdash;young people who
had been lost through their passion for
gaming. When these unfortunates were
restored to their friends, Abdallah permitted
the Evil One to leave his sack.</p>

<p>After a little, Abdallah, who was always
trying to make people happy, had a great
desire to return to his own home, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
he could see whether his father was still
unfortunate. On his way thither he met
a big boy who was crying at the top of
his voice and wringing his hands.</p>

<p>"Well, young man," said Abdallah, "is
your profession that of making faces? If
so, what do you ask for them by the
dozen?"</p>

<p>"I am not in a laughing humor, my
good sir," said the other.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, then?" exclaimed
Abdallah.</p>

<p>"My father," said the boy, "has fallen
from a horse and broken his arm. I ran
to the village for a physician, but, knowing
that we were poor no one of them
would stir themselves in my father's behalf."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Abdallah; but the
child continued to weep. "Calm yourself,"
said Abdallah, "your father shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
lack for anything. Tell me the name of
the first physician you went after."</p>

<p>"His name," said the boy, "is Abdel-Meddin."</p>

<p>"Observe well," said Abdallah. "Dr.
Abdel-Meddin, jump into my sack!" and
immediately a man appeared and fell into
the wonderful sack. At the order of its
master the stick began to beat him.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the boy, "what a beautiful
sack you have! Will you give it to
me?"</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Abdallah, "but take
this purse of gold; it will do you more
good."</p>

<p>All this time the doctor in the sack was
yelling at the top of his voice, and writhing
and moaning. Abdallah stopped the
stick, and then said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Physician, take advantage of this
opportunity to rub your bruised limbs, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
you shall not come out of here until you
are mashed into a jelly.</p>

<p>"Mercy," cried the doctor, "what have
I done to deserve so terrible a chastisement?"</p>

<p>"Do you dare to ask me?" cried Abdallah.
"Do you not recognize this unfortunate
child?"</p>

<p>"Have mercy! take pity on me!" cried
the physician.</p>

<p>"You did not take pity on others," said
Abdallah, "and I shall be inexorable toward
you. Beat him, stick!"</p>

<p>The wicked physician howled with pain
and fear, until finally Abdallah said:</p>

<p>"Stop, stick!"</p>

<p>"I implore your mercy," cried the physician.</p>

<p>"Will you give me your word to take
care of this poor boy's father if I release
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"I will do whatever you say," said the
unfortunate doctor! "He shall lack for
nothing."</p>

<p>"Then come out of the sack," said Abdallah.</p>

<p>The doctor came out, and he was so
badly bruised that he could scarcely stand
on his feet, but Abdallah made him walk.</p>

<p>Returning to the village, the doctor was
so attentive to the poor sick man that there
could be no doubt of his recovery, and
Abdallah went on his way, anxious to see
his father.</p>

<p>After several days of travelling he came
to a dense forest, through which he was
compelled to pass. Looking closely, he
saw a pathway, which was scarcely discernible,
and it was bordered on each side by
thorns and brambles. This path led to a
castle belonging to a terrible and cruel
giant. The sun had gone down and night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
had set in, and Abdallah knocked at the
door of the castle.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said a voice.</p>

<p>"A poor traveller who begs for lodging."</p>

<p>"I receive no one unless it is giants
who desire to have a tilt with me. We
feast at night, and in the morning I hang
them to a tree in the forest."</p>

<p>"Well," said Abdallah, "I will have a
tilt with you in the morning. Open the
door and let me come in."</p>

<p>"Poor fool," said the giant, "will you
dare to contend with me?"</p>

<p>"I will do my best," said Abdallah.
"Open the door, I beg you."</p>

<p>"Go away," said the giant, "I do not
wish to crush you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Giant! would you be afraid
to-day, and have I the power to make
you tremble?"</p>

<p>"Poor creature, your impudence shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
have its punishment. Come in! but to-morrow
you shall be hanged."</p>

<p>"While I am waiting to balance myself
on a limb," said Abdallah, cheerfully,
"have my supper prepared. My appetite
is large."</p>

<p>The cruel giant smiled at Abdallah's
pretensions, and as he was a charming
man himself, he took occasion to divert
Abdallah. The supper was fine, and the
evening was very pleasant. The giant
related his exploits. He had fought a
lion, and he had vanquished a sea-serpent
with seven heads which had attacked him.
One day, when an army came to attack
him, he had the soldiers hung to the trees
that surrounded his castle.</p>

<p>"Great giant," said Abdallah, smiling,
"you make me tremble. It would be
easy for you to get satisfaction out of a
poor unfortunate creature like me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"Miserable creature!" said the giant,
"I warned you before you came into my
castle. But eat and drink&mdash;above all,
drink, for to-morrow shall be your last
day."</p>

<p>"Let us drink, Mr. Giant! let us drink,
since the night still belongs to me. Here's
to your health!"</p>

<p>Overcome with fatigue, Abdallah left
the giant and went to sleep, for he stood
greatly in need of rest, and in the morning
he was still asleep when the giant came to
awake him.</p>

<p>"Get up!" the giant exclaimed. "You
have lived long enough. Let us cross
swords and see who will be the victor."</p>

<p>"It is useless," said Abdallah; "the
combat would be too unequal. Let me
go, I pray you."</p>

<p>"No," said the giant, severely; "you
must die. Come quickly, I am in a hurry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," said Abdallah, "since you
insist on it, we will fight, but I regret it, I
assure you, for I really do not want to kill
you."</p>

<p>"Enough!" exclaimed the giant; "your
insolence will soon be punished."</p>

<p>At this the giant raised his great hand
with the intention of crushing his opponent,
when Abdallah suddenly cried out:</p>

<p>"Jump in my sack!"</p>

<p>The giant made a horrible grimace, and
seemed to hesitate, but, at last, with a loud
cry, he threw himself into the marvellous
sack.</p>

<p>"Stick, do your duty!" exclaimed Abdallah,
and the magic stick, in a livelier
manner than ever began to whack the
cruel giant with great energy.</p>

<p>"Do have mercy!" exclaimed the giant.
"Take pity on me!" Abdallah had mercy
and the stick stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of our contest?"
asked Abdallah. "Have you a mind to
renew it?"</p>

<p>"You are a terrible sorcerer," said the
giant, "and I have never seen one like
you."</p>

<p>"Then," said Abdallah, "you are conquered."</p>

<p>"Have it as you will," said the giant.
"What can I say to the contrary?"</p>

<p>"You are right," said Abdallah. "Good-by,
Mr. Giant. You should be more hospitable
another time."</p>

<p>The giant was anxious to accompany
Abdallah, and he persisted in going with
him until he had passed through the forest.
Abdallah continued on his journey,
and it was not long before he arrived at
home, where he was gratified to embrace
his old father.</p>

<p>"My dear father!" he exclaimed, "I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
very rich. I am powerful and I come to
you."</p>

<p>"My dear child," said the old man,
"you deceive yourself, or my eyes have
become very weak; for I only see a sack
on your back and a stick in your hand."</p>

<p>"No, father," the son cried, "we are
rich, very rich. Hereafter we shall enjoy
everything in abundance, and since the
famine still continues, our neighbors will
enjoy our good fortune."</p>

<p>In a few words, Abdallah told his father
how he had been abandoned by his brothers;
and he told the old man also of the
wonderful virtues of his enchanted sack.</p>

<p>"Your kind-heartedness, my son," said
the old man, "has had its reward, but let
us not, in our prosperity, forget those who
are sad and cry because they are hungry."</p>

<p>"Do not trouble yourself, my father.
For such as these our table will always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
spread, and our doors will never be closed
against them."</p>

<p>While the famine in that country lasted,
Abdallah established a tavern, where everybody
could get a meal without money and
without price. The marvellous sack was
always ready to carry out the will of its
master, and it was always ready to furnish
the most savory dishes and the most exquisite
wines, and this went on as long as
the famine lasted.</p>

<p>When the famine had subsided, Abdallah
would not give any more, fearing that
he would encourage the unworthy and
thus render very indifferent service to the
country.</p>

<p>Abdallah ought to have been happy, but
he was not. He had such a good and
tender heart that he easily forgot and forgave
all the injury that had been done
him, and he was sad because he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
see around him all the wicked brothers
who had forsaken him on the way.</p>

<p>He called their names daily and commanded
them to jump in his sack. Each
time, however, he found in his sack
only a pile of bones. His brothers were
surely dead, and when Abdallah came
to understand this fact, he shed bitter
tears.</p>

<p>In his turn, Abdallah's father died, and
Abdallah himself grew very old. When
he felt that his end was approaching he
drew a sigh of relief, nevertheless he did
not want to die without seeing the good
fairy who had been his benefactor.</p>

<p>Feeling thus, Abdallah started on a
journey, trembling with emotion, and it
was not long before he reached the spot
where he had met the gracious fairy. He
seated himself on a stone and waited for
the good fairy to appear; but she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
not. He continued to wait, and, after a
time, Death came along the road.</p>

<p>"I am hunting for you," said the grim
traveller.</p>

<p>"Not for me, surely," said Abdallah.</p>

<p>"Yes, for you," said the other.</p>

<p>"I am waiting here for a friend," said
Abdallah.</p>

<p>"Do I seem to be an enemy?" asked
Death.</p>

<p>"No, no," cried Abdallah, "you are
welcome, but I want an opportunity to
greet my benefactor. I cannot go with
you."</p>

<p>But Death fixed his eyes on Abdallah,
smiled a little, and said:</p>

<p>"Jump in my sack!"</p>

<h2>X<br />
<span class="small">A SEARCH FOR A FRIEND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A rich merchant of Bagdad had a son
that he loved most tenderly. The child
had been reared with the utmost care, and
no pains were spared to cultivate his mind
as well as his affections. When the young
man's education was almost completed his
father determined that he should travel in
foreign parts.</p>

<p>"My son," said the old man, "I have
gray hairs and a white beard, and in my
long career it has been given to me to
know and appreciate the real value of men
and things. You must learn, then, my
son, that among the pressing necessities of
life the greatest of all is a good friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Riches take wings&mdash;a touch of providence,
a turn of the wheel of fortune, throws the
richest into the depths of despair; but
death alone, which carries all off, can take
away a friend.</p>

<p>"A true friend is the only thing in this
world that is always faithful. Find this
rare pearl, my son, and you will have found
the rarest of gems. I want you, then, my
son, to travel over the world, travel alone
gives the real experience. The more we
see of men the better we know how to live
among them. The world is a great and a
beautiful book, that instructs those who
know how to read it. It is a faithful mirror
that reflects all the objects we ought
to see.</p>

<p>"Go, my son," said the merchant of
Bagdad; "take this travelling-stick, and
in your journeyings think, above all other
things, of the necessity of securing a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
friend. In pursuing this object, sacrifice
everything else, even what is most rare and
most precious."</p>

<p>The young man embraced his father and
took his departure. He went to a foreign
country and remained there some time, and
then he returned to his own country.
When he arrived, his father, astonished at
his quick return, said:</p>

<p>"I did not expect you so soon."</p>

<p>"You told me to seek a friend," said the
young man. "Well, I have returned with
fifty who are all that you have described."</p>

<p>"My poor child!" responded the old
merchant, "do not speak so flippantly of
so sacred a name. A true friend is so rare
that he cannot be found in droves, and
those who pretend to be such are only so in
name. They resemble a summer-cloud that
melts beneath the first rays of the sun."</p>

<p>"Father!" exclaimed the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
"your attack is unjust, and those that I
look upon as my friends&mdash;those whom I
regard as my friends&mdash;would not see me
suffering or in adversity unless their hearts
went out to me."</p>

<p>"I have lived seventy years," responded
the old man, "and I have been tried by
good and bad fortune. I have known a
great many men, and during these long
years it has been well-nigh impossible for
me to acquire a friend. How, at your age,
and in such a short time, have you been
able to find fifty friends? Learn from me,
my son, to know human nature."</p>

<p>The old merchant strangled a sheep,
put the carcass in a sack, and stained his
son's clothing with the blood of the animal.
At night the young man was told what he
must do, and he took the carcass of the
sheep on his shoulder and went out of the
city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>Soon he arrived at the house of his first
friend, and knocked at the door, which
was promptly opened to him. His friend
asked him what he wanted.</p>

<p>"It is in the midst of misfortune that
friendship is put to a trial," responded the
young man. "I have often told you of
an old feud that has existed between our
family and that of a lord of the court.
Not long ago we met in a secluded spot.
Hatred placed arms in our hands, and he
fell lifeless at my feet. For fear of being
pursued by justice I seized his body; it is
in the sack you see on my shoulders. I
beg you to hide it in your house until this
affair has blown over."</p>

<p>"My house is so small," said the friend,
with an air of sorrow and embarrassment,
"that it can scarcely contain the living
who dwell in it. How could I find room
for the dead?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>The young man begged his friend to
have pity on him, but without avail, and
the ungrateful man shut the door in his
face.</p>

<p>"You see, my son," said the old merchant,
"these are the kind of friends on
whom you were depending."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, father," said the
young man, "I have always suspected that
this particular friend was a hypocrite, but
all are not so. Wait, and you shall see."</p>

<p>The younger man continued to knock
at the doors of his friends. Fifty times he
met with the same reception. No one
wanted to do him the kindness to hide
the body.</p>

<p>"My son," said the old merchant, "you
must see at last how little you can depend
on man. What has become of the friends
whom you were praising to me a little
while ago? In your supposed misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
each one has forsaken you. I will show
you the difference between the one real
friend that I have and the fifty false ones
whom you have tested."</p>

<p>As they talked, the father and son
reached the door of the house of the one
whom the old merchant had represented
as the model of perfect friendship. The
merchant related to his friend the imaginary
misfortunes that had befallen his
son, and begged the friend to hide the
compromising sack.</p>

<p>"Oh, happy day and blessed hour!"
exclaimed the faithful friend. "My house
is large, and herein you may hide whatever
you choose."</p>

<p>"Think," said the young man, "of the
great dangers to which you expose yourself!
Who knows but you may be accused
of the murder, or, at least, of favoring the
assassin."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the other, smiling, "one
must expose one's self to many perils
when one desires to save the son of a
friend. Go to my summer residence,
where you will be safe from the clutches
of the law. I will come to you from time
to time, and keep you company, and if
ever misfortune happens to you it will
likewise fall on me."</p>

<p>At this the merchant of Bagdad opened
his arms and pressed to his heart the devoted
friend, thanking him for his generous
offers, and relating to him the simple
artifice by which he had taught his son
how rare true friendship is in this world.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XI<br />
<span class="small">A CHILD OF THE ROSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a King who
had three daughters as beautiful as the
stars that shine in the skies, and as different
in their beauty. One day the King
was sitting on his gorgeous throne, and he
called his children, and said:</p>

<p>"I love you all better than I do my life.
Now tell me in turn the nature of the affection
you feel for me. According to
your answer I shall give each of you the
husband that you deserve. The eldest approached,
and said:</p>

<p>"I love you better than I do my golden
hair and my blue eyes, and I would do anything
in the world to be agreeable to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span></p>

<p>"My beloved daughter," exclaimed the
Monarch, "the King of Syra shall become
your husband."</p>

<p>The second daughter spoke thus:</p>

<p>"I love you, my father, a thousand times
better than a queen loves her crown, a
thousand times better than a dove loves
her young, and to please you I would voluntarily
throw myself into a burning furnace."</p>

<p>"Oh, my child! let me embrace you!
The Prince Miraz, the handsomest of men,
shall be your husband."</p>

<p>The youngest daughter, the favorite of
the fairies, the charming Mirza, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I love you, my father, as we love the
salt in the bread, as the fish loves water,
and as the May rose loves the dews of the
morning."</p>

<p>At these words the King turned pale
with anger, and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>"Go away! Leave me! You are an
ungrateful daughter who cares for no one.
Is it thus that you show gratitude for the
pains I have taken with you? The love
you have for me goes no further than the
salt in the bread. Go away!"</p>

<p>The King drove his daughter from the
palace, and ordered one of the waiting-maids
to follow her everywhere, and to
return only to announce her death. The
waiting-maid took with her her own
daughter, Calamir, and the three women
travelled at haphazard for three days and
three nights. Finally they perceived an
abandoned cabin, and the Princess cried
out:</p>

<p>"Let us stop here!" whereupon the
women took up their abode there.</p>

<p>One day Mirza was sitting by the roadside,
her head in her hands, weeping sadly.
She was thinking of the great palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
where she was born, and of her more fortunate
sisters, who lacked for nothing, and
who had bracelets of gold and diamonds.
She thought also of her cruel father,
whom she still loved with all her heart.
Suddenly Mirza felt a hand on her shoulder,
and began to tremble with fear. It
was the Queen of the Fairies, who looked
at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"My beautiful child, why lament?"
said the Queen. "All things are possible
to me. Make three wishes and you will
be satisfied at once."</p>

<p>Mirza, however, did not answer. She
remained silent; she could only weep.</p>

<p>"Grief fills your heart," said the Queen
of the Fairies, "and you can only weep.
You are thinking of your father, your sisters,
and the palace where you were born.
Calm yourself. Hereafter you will be as
rich and as fortunate as they. Weeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
or smiling, walking or standing, no person
in the wide world will be as fortunate as
you."</p>

<p>At these words the young girl smiled,
and beautiful roses fell from her lips.
She took a few steps to embrace her benefactress,
and a thousand precious stones
fell under her feet. The tears that shone
in her eyes, in falling, became pearls.</p>

<p>"Kind fairy," exclaimed Mirza, beholding
these things, "what wishes could I
have made that would have been comparable
to these gifts you have heaped upon
me? A thousand thanks!"</p>

<p>The young girl pressed the queen of the
fairies to her heart, kissed her hands and
her lips, and gave full play to her happiness.
Some days afterward, the Princess
Mirza said to her waiting-maid:</p>

<p>"Go into the neighboring city, inquire
for the best architect to be found and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
him to bring a hundred experienced workmen."</p>

<p>The maid went into the city, secured
the architect, and when three days had
passed the workmen arrived.</p>

<p>"Queen of women," said the architect,
"what can I do to please you?"</p>

<p>"I want you to build me a marvellous
palace of pure gold, with ten doors of diamonds
and a thousand windows of crystal.
Build me a palace supported by a hundred
columns of rubies and emeralds. I
want it to be so resplendent that the
neighboring kings and princes will stand
amazed when they behold it."</p>

<p>The builders went to work, and in the
course of a year the masterpiece of architecture
was completed. One day the sisters
of the princess passed that way.
They were going to see their parents, and
a joyous escort accompanied them, playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
on a thousand instruments in order to
make the journey pleasant.</p>

<p>"My gentle pages," exclaimed the eldest,
perceiving the palace, "to whom does
this magnificent building belong? Is it
the home of the fairies?"</p>

<p>"Gracious queen," responded one of the
pages, "no one knows."</p>

<p>"Go, then," said the princess, "and find
out, and say that we desire to visit this
wonderful palace."</p>

<p>When the messengers announced to
Mirza the wishes of the princess, she exclaimed,
rapturously:</p>

<p>"These are my sisters&mdash;the children of
my mother&mdash;who come to visit me. Happy
day! Pages, return and tell them that
I await them."</p>

<p>But the pages did not move. Each one
seemed to be petrified with surprise and
admiration. While Mirza was speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the most beautiful and fragrant roses fell
from her lips, and at her feet hundreds of
precious stones, pearls, rubies, amethysts,
and diamonds sparkled and glittered.
Finally the messengers returned to the
princesses, and when the latter found that
this beautiful palace belonged to their
younger sister, they could not refrain from
shedding tears of joy. Immediately they
made their way to the palace, and soon
they had the pleasure of embracing the
sister whom they had long given up for
lost.</p>

<p>The two princesses stayed a long time
at the grand palace, their eyes dazzled at
everything they saw. They were much
astonished at the magnificent gifts showered
on them by their sister. They went
away from the palace with regret, and they
were very sorry they could not carry away
with them, in addition to their gifts, pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of the precious stones with which the
courtyard was paved.</p>

<p>The renown of Mirza soon spread
throughout all the neighboring kingdoms,
and everyone praised her beauty and marvelled
at her riches. The prince of a
strange country fell desperately in love
with her, and he sent an ambassador to sue
for her hand. Mirza consented, and promised
to become the wife of the prince as
soon as the orange-trees blossomed. The
ambassador was delighted, and hastened to
announce the joyous news to his master.
Magnificent feasts were given at the court
of the prince, and soon everything was
ready for the wedding.</p>

<p>As soon as the orange-trees bloomed,
Mirza started on her journey to the home
of the prince, accompanied by the waiting-maid
who had served her in her misfortune.
On the way, the princess became very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
hungry, and asked for something to eat.
Instead of giving her sweet cakes and
luscious fruits, the maid gave her bread
that was so salty and so bitter the princess
could scarcely swallow it. Soon she was
seized with a devouring thirst.</p>

<p>"My good friend," she exclaimed to
her maid, "what have you for me to
drink?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my amiable mistress," said
the maid.</p>

<p>"What! not even a glass of water?"
said the princess.</p>

<p>"No, your majesty."</p>

<p>The princess withstood the thirst as
long as she could, and finally said:</p>

<p>"I pray you, my good friend, go and
find a stream, and bring me some water
to quench my thirst&mdash;only a few drops."</p>

<p>At this, the waiting-maid said:</p>

<p>"Alas! we are in a very strange country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Here, water is the dearest of all beverages."</p>

<p>"Well," said the princess, "take a handful
of diamonds and offer them to the
charitable person who will take pity on me
and give me some water."</p>

<p>The waiting-maid started out, but she
did not go a hundred steps when she hid
herself behind a bush. Very soon she returned
with an air of distress, and with a
sad voice she spoke thus:</p>

<p>"Powerful princess, in this country,
water is so dear that you will have to pay
for a single goblet-full with one of your
eyes."</p>

<p>In her despair, the young princess pulled
out an eye, and gave it to the waiting-maid.</p>

<p>"Go," said the princess, "run quick, or
I die."</p>

<p>The cruel waiting-maid returned, bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
a little water, but scarcely did it quench
her thirst for an instant. Not long afterward
the princess began lamenting again:</p>

<p>"I am still thirsty," said she, "and I feel
that I am perishing."</p>

<p>"Give me your remaining eye," said the
servant, "and hereafter you shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>The bewildered young princess consented
to make the sacrifice. This time,
she thought, she could drink to her heart's
content. Night came and the sun sank
behind the horizon, and the perfidious servant
stripped her mistress of her fine
clothes and gave them to her own daughter,
Calamir. The poor blind girl was left
by the roadside, and the waiting-maid and
her daughter continued their journey toward
the city where the prince resided.</p>

<p>When they arrived all the bells in the
churches rang out their joyous chimes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
The people went out to meet her, and the
prince tenderly embraced the one whom
he thought was his betrothed. Never had
such a scene been witnessed in that city.
The wedding feast was brilliant and splendid.
One thing, however, disturbed the
prince. He had been told that a rose fell
from the lips of the princess at each smile,
and that under her feet diamonds sprung.
He did not see any of these things. Puzzled
at this, he inquired of his wife's
mother:</p>

<p>"Madam, how is it that roses do not
fall from the lips of your child, and that
precious stones do not appear when she
walks?"</p>

<p>"My dear prince, my child is fatigued
at the long journey she undertook to come
to you. Have patience, and you will soon
be satisfied."</p>

<p>During all this time, the poor Mirza,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
the real princess, wandered alone in the
frightful desert in which she had been forsaken.
She called for help, but no one
came to her assistance. Her cries grew
louder, and at last they attracted the attention
of an old woman who was gathering
herbs for the purpose of making medicine.</p>

<p>"What do you wish, my beautiful
child?" inquired the old woman.</p>

<p>"Good mother, what are you doing
here?" cried the princess.</p>

<p>"I am looking for herbs that are necessary
to make my medicine."</p>

<p>"You can do better than that," said the
princess. "Pick up the pearls that you
find at my feet, and go into the city and
sell them."</p>

<p>The old woman obeyed, and returned
with an apron full of gold, saying:</p>

<p>"My child, what shall I do with this
fortune?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p>"It is for you, my good woman, but on
one condition."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>The poor blind girl smiled, and from her
lips fell a rose so beautiful and sweet that
there had been none like it before. Mirza
answered:</p>

<p>"Take this rose and go into the prince's
city, and call out, 'Who will buy this
flower? who will buy this rose?'"</p>

<p>"And in order to please you," said the
old woman, "how much must I sell it
for?"</p>

<p>"You must give it," said the princess,
"for neither gold nor silver."</p>

<p>"And for what shall I sell it?" said the
old woman.</p>

<p>"You shall demand an eye for it," said
the princess.</p>

<p>The old woman followed the directions
to the letter. When she arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
in the city of the prince, she cried
out:</p>

<p>"Who will buy this flower? Who will
buy this rose?"</p>

<p>At these words, Mirza's deceitful servant
ran to the window of the palace and
asked:</p>

<p>"Tell me, good woman, for what will
you sell such a beautiful rose?"</p>

<p>"I will sell it for an eye," said the old
woman.</p>

<p>"Heavens! what would you do with an
eye?" said the maid-servant.</p>

<p>"That is my affair," said the old woman.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the waiting-maid,
"stay a moment;" and she ran to her
room; and as she had been careful enough
to save the eyes of her mistress, she took
one and gave it to the old woman.</p>

<p>"Take this, good woman," she exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>"And here is your rose," said the old
woman.</p>

<p>At night, when the prince returned
to the palace, his mother-in-law said to
him:</p>

<p>"See this beautiful rose. There is none
like it in the flower-gardens. My daughter
made it with a smile."</p>

<p>"It came in good time," said the young
prince, "but I can scarcely believe it. A
thousand times I have seen your daughter
smile, and nothing has fallen from her
lips."</p>

<p>All this time, the old woman, who had
sold her rose for the eye, was on her way
to the Princess Mirza. But as she went
along, the eye fell from her hand and was
lost. She hunted for it a long time, but
meanwhile the eye, apparently directed by
the good fairies, made its way to the blind
girl, who put it in its place and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
she saw clearly. The old woman returned
disconsolate.</p>

<p>"Alas! my beautiful child," she exclaimed,
weeping, "I sold your rose as
you directed me, but, unfortunately, the
eye I received as the price escaped from
my hands and I could not find it, though
I hunted for it far and wide."</p>

<p>"Do not trouble yourself, my good
woman," and Mirza smiled, and another
rose fell from her lips.</p>

<p>"Go," said she again, "and sell this
flower on the same conditions."</p>

<p>The rose was carried to the castle as the
other had been, and sold for the other eye.</p>

<p>The princess recovered her sight, and
regained her beauty. Shortly afterward,
the beautiful Mirza said to her companion:</p>

<p>"Go into the towns and villages, and inquire
by which road the king of this country
goes on his hunting excursions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>This order having been obeyed, the
young princess sent for a number of workmen
and an architect. On her way in
search of these, the old woman met a little
gray man who had a hump on his back.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Margaret?"
cried the little hunchback.</p>

<p>"I am hunting for workmen and for an
architect," she replied.</p>

<p>"I am your man," exclaimed the dwarf.</p>

<p>"Are you capable?" asked the old
woman.</p>

<p>"Patience, Margaret! patience!" exclaimed
the little gray man. "Of that
you will have to judge later."</p>

<p>Mirza accepted the dwarf as her architect,
but she could not help saying to
him:</p>

<p>"Little gray man, where are your workmen?
Do you think to build by yourself
the palace I desire?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely had she finished speaking,
when, at the sound of a low whistle from
the little gray man, there appeared on all
sides hundreds and thousands of brownies,
who were cutting all sorts of antics and
capers. Some jumped, some ran, some
walked on their hands, and some floated in
the air as light as thistle-down. But each
of them, when he passed before the little
gray man, said:</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, what do you wish to-day
of your faithful subjects?"</p>

<p>To these questions the little gray man
replied:</p>

<p>"Make the most beautiful palace to be
found in all the world."</p>

<p>Mirza, the princess, was filled with astonishment.
Never before had she seen so
many brownies gathered together in one
place, and she said to herself, "Surely
these must be the children of the fairies;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
and, full of happiness, she went here and
there, speaking a kind word to all, and at
every step she took hundreds of precious
stones were scattered under her feet, and,
at each smile a rose fell.</p>

<p>At last all the brownies were set to work
under the direction of the little gray man.
Some felled the great trees of the forest and
trimmed them, some delved in the mines
for marble and precious stones, and others
forged the rare metals out of which the vast
columns of the palace were to be made.</p>

<p>Rapidly the new palace was built, and
when it was finished it shone in the land
like a rare jewel in the bosom of a beautiful
woman.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the little gray man
to the beautiful Mirza, "are you satisfied
with my work, and do you repent having
chosen me for your architect?"</p>

<p>"Powerful and most generous King of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
the Brownies," she said to the little gray
man, "how can I be dissatisfied at the
sight of this rare palace, which you have
built for me?"</p>

<p>"This being so," said the little gray
man, "what is to be my reward?"</p>

<p>At this the young girl smiled, and a
beautiful rose dropped from her lips.</p>

<p>"This shall be your reward," said she,
giving him the flower.</p>

<p>"Thanks! thanks!" exclaimed the little
gray man, and he instantly disappeared.
The brownies were paid in the same way,
and the young girl soon found herself
alone with the old woman.</p>

<p>One day passed, then two, then three,
and still the prince did not come hunting.
At this Mirza grew impatient, and she
said to the old woman.</p>

<p>"Go to the top of the hill and see if the
prince is not coming."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>The old woman went to the top of the
hill, and looked around on all sides, but
there was nothing in sight. The roads on
every side were dusty and deserted, and
she returned to her mistress.</p>

<p>"What did you see?" inquired the
princess.</p>

<p>"Nothing, your majesty, but the floating
clouds and the beautiful flowers."</p>

<p>"Go, then, and look again," said Mirza.</p>

<p>The old woman looked again and then
returned.</p>

<p>"What have you seen?" inquired the
princess.</p>

<p>"The waters flowing, the grasses growing,
and in the limbs of the trees I heard
the breezes murmuring."</p>

<p>"Return and look again."</p>

<p>So the woman went, and when she had
come back the princess said:</p>

<p>"What have you seen?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>"Away in the distance, on the dusty
road, I saw horsemen coming."</p>

<p>"It is the prince," said Mirza; and, sure
enough, the prince, followed by his retainers,
his huntsmen, and his dogs, soon made
his appearance. Suddenly, the prince,
seized with admiration, paused and looked
around him. Here, where there had been
only briars and brambles, there arose before
his view the marvellous palace that
had been erected by the little gray man.</p>

<p>"To whom does this dazzling palace belong?"
asked the prince, but no one could
answer him. "Await me here," said the
prince to his followers, "I will go and inquire,
but I will return immediately."</p>

<p>He approached the door and knocked,
but there was no response, and one would
have supposed the palace was uninhabited.
He knocked again, but everything was silent
except the clamorous echoes which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
himself had aroused. Then the prince
climbed up to the nearest window, opened
the blinds, and found himself in a marvellous
saloon which was uninhabited. He
pursued his way through beautiful halls
and apartments, until he came to a room
more beautiful than the rest.</p>

<p>On a bed of gold, Mirza was reclining, and
as he approached she arose and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Who has dared enter my palace?"</p>

<p>"Powerful princess," said the young
man, "I am your slave. Do with me as
you will."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she cried.</p>

<p>"The king of all this country&mdash;the most
unfortunate of men since I have seen
you."</p>

<p>At these words the young girl smiled,
and from her lips fell a rose. She took a
few steps forward, and precious stones
covered the carpet where she walked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"What do I see?" exclaimed the
prince, filled with astonishment. "Are
you not Mirza, my affianced?"</p>

<p>"Yes," cried the happy girl, "I am
Mirza, who loves you; I am Mirza, whose
hand you demanded in marriage through
an ambassador."</p>

<p>At the remembrance of her misfortunes
tears shone in her eyes, and pearls fell
therefrom.</p>

<p>The prince was overjoyed; he had been
deceived, but he was now happy. Mirza
told him all, and he would have had the
deceitful servants burned at the stake, but
the princess interceded for them and they
were banished from the country. The
prince and Mirza lived long and happily
together.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
<span class="small">THE KING OF THE LIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A Donkey one day thought that the
time had come for him to go and seek his
fortune; so he broke his halter and ran
away into the broad fields. The grass was
high and rank, and there was no lack of
thistles. Happy over his good fortune,
Brother Donkey brayed so loud and so
joyously that Mr. Lion, who happened to
be passing that way, stopped to inquire
what the matter could be.</p>

<p>At the sight of Brother Donkey, Mr.
Lion was paralyzed with astonishment.
Never, in all his wanderings, had he seen
such a creature. Mr. Lion looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Brother Donkey from a distance. Then
he approached a little nearer, and finally
mustered up courage to say:</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what is your
name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Brother Donkey," replied
the other, "and I am the ruler of all
Donkeydom."</p>

<p>"I do not know that country," said Mr.
Lion, "but I myself am a monarch, and
the most of the other animals have chosen
me for their king."</p>

<p>"If that is the case," said Brother Donkey,
"we are brothers, and we will continue
our travels together."</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure," responded
Mr. Lion. "One can only gain by being
in good company."</p>

<p>So the two started on their journey together.
As they went along, Mr. Lion
thought he saw that Brother Donkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
was not as formidable as he had at first
appeared. There was something in his
gait, something in his appearance, that led
to this suspicion, and when he saw a tiger,
he seemed to be so frightened that the
King of the Desert said:</p>

<p>"Come, my friend, and let us wrestle
together for fun."</p>

<p>"No, no, my comrade," exclaimed
Brother Donkey, "for I am so strong that
in spite of myself I should be compelled
to crush you with my feet."</p>

<p>Mr. Lion, thinking this was true, made
a profound bow to the King of Donkeydom,
and the two continued on their journey
together. It so happened that they
had to cross a river. With one bound Mr.
Lion reached the other side, but, on the
contrary, Brother Donkey went down into
the water and began to swim in a very
awkward manner; so awkward, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
that it seemed he was in danger of drowning.</p>

<p>"How is it," exclaimed Mr. Lion, in
astonishment, "that you cannot swim?"</p>

<p>"What, I?" said Brother Donkey. "I
split the water more rapidly than a boat,
and the fishes themselves could not beat
me in a race."</p>

<p>"If that is true," said Mr. Lion, "why
does it take you so long to cross a stream?"</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Brother Donkey, "it
was because I had caught with my tail an
eel so large and heavy that I was about to
sink, and I was compelled to turn it loose
in order to rejoin you."</p>

<p>Mr. Lion was satisfied with this answer,
and the two friends resumed their journey.
As they went along they soon came to a
high stone wall. Mr. Lion leaped over it
at a bound, but Brother Donkey was
unable to get over so quickly. He raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
himself on his hindlegs, placed his forefeet
on the wall, and hung suspended there.
Mr. Lion, seeing this, cried out:</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?"</p>

<p>"Do you not see," said Brother Donkey,
"that I am weighing myself? I
want to see if the part of my body in front
is as heavy as the part that is behind."</p>

<p>Brother Donkey, after great effort, at
last succeeded in getting over the wall.
Mr. Lion then said to his companion:</p>

<p>"Powerful King of Donkeydom, my esteemed
friend! I believe that you are
making sport of me. I believe that your
strength, at its best, is no greater than that
of a child."</p>

<p>"Do you have such a thought as that?"
said Brother Donkey, with a smile. "You
make a serious mistake, great King of
Beasts. Let us make a trial of strength
right here. Let us see which of us is able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
to destroy that great wall. The one that
is victorious will be known as the king of
the animals."</p>

<p>"This is a good idea," exclaimed Mr.
Lion, heartily, "and I accept your conditions
with pleasure."</p>

<p>Immediately Mr. Lion made an effort
to show his power. He struck the wall
with his paws, and then with his tail. He
struck it on the right and on the left, but
he only wounded himself. He did not
succeed in making one stone fall. At the
end of a quarter of an hour he gave up in
despair.</p>

<p>"I cannot make an impression on this
strong wall," said Mr. Lion. "Let us see
if you will be more fortunate."</p>

<p>At once Brother Donkey began to bray
and kick, and he used his heels with such
effect that in a few minutes the wall was
knocked down and destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of this?" cried
Brother Donkey. "Do you still think
you are stronger than I am?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Lion, humbly. "Until
to-day I had thought myself the king of
animals, but I was mistaken, and the title
belongs to you hereafter."</p>

<p>"But even yet," said Brother Donkey,
"you do not know what I can do."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Lion, "what can you
do that is so extraordinary?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Brother Donkey, "I
can eat thorns."</p>

<p>"Thorns!" exclaimed Mr. Lion. "Do
you really mean what you say?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Brother Donkey, "I
am telling you the simple truth."</p>

<p>"I would not dispute your word," said
Mr. Lion, "but I am really anxious to see
you perform this wonderful feat."</p>

<p>"Do you see the thistles growing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
there in that field?" inquired Brother
Donkey.</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," said Mr. Lion.</p>

<p>"Well," said Brother Donkey, "I am
going to eat them."</p>

<p>Then Brother Donkey, who had not
eaten since morning, began to devour the
thistles. Astonished at this, Mr. Lion
said to Brother Donkey:</p>

<p>"I think you are the most extraordinary
creature I ever saw, and I want you to be
recognized as King of the Lions. Do you
consent?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," Brother Donkey replied.</p>

<p>The next day, or shortly thereafter, a convention
of all the lions was held, and
Brother Donkey was elected king without
any opposition whatever. He reigned over
them many years, and he was the better
able to do this from the fact that he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
disputed with his subjects over their prey.
Brother Donkey ate his thistles and the
lions ate their fresh meat, and all was
peace in that country.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XIII<br />
<span class="small">THE VIZIER, THE MONKEY, THE<br />
LION, AND THE SERPENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once on a time a ruler who was the
king of men, as well as the king of beasts,
called his Vizier, Rustem, to whom he
had confided the education of his only
son, and said:</p>

<p>"Tell me, does my son follow your advice,
and does he give promise of making
a worthy successor of his father?"</p>

<p>"Though he is still youthful, the young
prince bids fair to become the king of
men," said Rustem; "your son is already
fitted to rule both man and beast."</p>

<p>Never was a vizier so untruthful; never
had a tutor so corrupted a young prince.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
He had implanted in his pupil's mind the
vices which were his own. He had made
him greedy, unjust, and impatient at the
least contradiction. The Vizier had made
the young prince believe that the people
whom he was one day to govern were a
lot of miserable cattle who were to be imposed
on at the King's will.</p>

<p>It happened in those days that a merchant
came to the King's palace, having
for sale a collection of rich jewels. He
had them of all kinds and all prices&mdash;diamonds,
pearls, rubies, and emeralds&mdash;all
heaped together in a beautiful casket of
carved cedarwood. The Prince remained
for hours admiring this marvellous collection
of treasures.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "how I wish I
had money enough to buy all that I
see!"</p>

<p>"Prince," said the Vizier, "are you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the master? Command, and these treasures
are yours."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the Prince, "so be
it;" and with that his slaves took possession
of the casket and drove the poor merchant
away from the palace.</p>

<p>The merchant, however, was not willing
to submit to such an injustice. He went
about making his charges and his complaints
in the public places, until at last
the matter became a scandal that could
not be overlooked. So the powerful
young Prince had him whipped with such
severity that he expired not far from the
palace.</p>

<p>The news of this terrible crime came
speedily to the ears of the King, who became
enraged with his son and with the
perfidious Rustem. He drove them both
from the palace. The tutor was banished
from the court, and the young Prince was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
placed in a castle at some distance from
his father's palace. Forgetting the irreparable
injury he had caused, the Vizier one
day went to see his former pupil. He
fancied he would be received with open
arms, as in the past; but what was his
surprise to find himself loaded with reproaches.
With a significant gesture the
young Prince ordered his old tutor from
his presence. The Vizier retired in confusion.
It was night, and for a long time
he wandered in the forest.</p>

<p>Vaguely walking about he fell in a pit
that had been set as a trap for wild animals.
What was his terror to find himself
in the company of a Lion, a Monkey, and
a Serpent, each of whom had fallen into
the pit. When morning came the ex-vizier
found himself in the midst of sad
reflection. He was fearful that he would
lose by hunger the life these beasts had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
left him, when, all of a sudden, he saw a
man peering over the edge of the pitfall.
Then the Vizier set up a terrible cry, and
the traveller, touched with pity, threw him
a rope so that he could escape from his
perilous position.</p>

<p>The Monkey, nimbler than the Vizier,
seized the rope and ran up it, much to the
surprise of the traveller, who had expected
a different visitor.</p>

<p>"You will not be sorry for this," said
the Monkey, by way of apology. "I
know how to be grateful for a service,
and I know how to cherish a benefactor.
To prove to you that I am in earnest, I
will give you a piece of advice. Do not
rescue the man whose voice you heard in
the pitfall. He is a knave, and he will
soon cause you to repent of your generosity.
I live at the foot of the mountain
yonder, where I hope to meet you some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
day and be of service to you. Farewell!"</p>

<p>The traveller was not much impressed
with the words of the Monkey, but he allowed
the creature to go its way, and threw
the rope again into the pitfall in the hope
of rescuing his fellow-man, whose voice he
had heard.</p>

<p>In a moment he felt a considerable
weight on the rope, and he thought that
he was now rescuing the man, but, to his
utter surprise, a terrible Lion came climbing
up. His mane was shaggy, his teeth
were white and cruel, and his claws were
long and crooked. It seemed to the traveller
that he would be compelled to drop
this terrible creature back into the pitfall,
but the Lion's voice reassured him.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," said the Lion.
"You have won a protector whose services
are not to be disdained. You have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
given me my life to-day and perhaps I
may be able to save yours. Your fellow-man,
who is still in the pitfall, will
never be able to be of such service to
you."</p>

<p>The traveller thereupon redoubled his
efforts and drew the lion to the top.</p>

<p>"Friend," said the Lion, "my den is in
this forest, opposite the mountain. Come
and see me, and you will always be welcome."</p>

<p>There still remained two prisoners to
deliver, and the rope was thrown back in
the pit. The Serpent wound himself
around it, and was drawn up.</p>

<p>"Generous friend," cried the Serpent,
"I want to give you a piece of advice, and
as advice is considered to be cheap, I
have no idea that you will follow it. Serpents
are considered to be wise. I have
left in the bottom of this pitfall the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
outrageous impostor the world has ever
seen. Leave him to his fate if you do not
wish to regret your kindness. You seem
to be too kind, but on the faith of a serpent
I will deliver you out of the first difficulty
into which your good heart gets
you. My house is all along the walls of
the neighboring city."</p>

<p>But in spite of all this advice the traveller
was too generous to permit his fellow-man
to die in the pitfall, and for the
fourth time he dropped the rope. The
Vizier seized it and was saved. It is impossible
to describe the joy of the Vizier
at this turn of affairs. His expressions of
gratitude were effusive. He embraced his
deliverer and called him his saviour. He
wanted to relate his history to the traveller,
and, in doing so began to deceive his
benefactor. He spoke only of the injustice
of the King, and his discourse seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
to be so full of truth that the traveller was
grateful that it had fallen to his lot to rescue
so admirable a person.</p>

<p>"I live in the adjoining village," said
the deposed Vizier, "and I offer you a
home there. You shall be made welcome."</p>

<p>The traveller thanked him heartily, but
he had other ends in view. He was on
his way to the Ganges to purchase merchandise,
and he proceeded thither with
that inward satisfaction that arises from
the accomplishment of a good deed. On
the shores of the Ganges, in India, the
traveller entered into trade, and his fortunes
prospered. He soon found himself
possessed of a large sum of money,
and he was filled with a desire to see his
native country. He returned by the same
road, and, after travelling for some time,
he found himself once more in the forest
where, on a former occasion, his rope had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
been of such assistance to the unfortunates
who had fallen into the pit.</p>

<p>He remembered with pleasure the eloquent
words of the grateful Rustem, and
he regretted that he could not see his old
friend. As for the three animals&mdash;the
Monkey, the Lion, and the Snake&mdash;their
remarks had made but little impression on
his mind; he was only grateful to them
for not having devoured him.</p>

<p>While he was thinking of these things
the rich traveller found himself surrounded
with enemies even more ferocious than
the animals he had rescued. He found
himself in the midst of a band of thieves.
The robbers seized the traveller, compelled
him to dismount from his horse, took possession
of his treasures, and were preparing
to take his life, when the captain of
the band remarked that it would be a useless
murder. But the thieves bound the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
traveller at the foot of a tree, and left him
to die there of hunger.</p>

<p>The cries of the unfortunate traveller
reached the ears of the big Monkey that
had been rescued from the pitfall. His
instinct recognized the voice of his deliverer,
and he came to the rescue of the
traveller. The Monkey seized the bonds
in his strong teeth, and they soon fell
apart, and it was not long before the traveller
was free to go his way.</p>

<p>But the grateful Monkey took him to
his home, where fresh fruits appeased his
hunger, and cool and pure water quenched
his thirst. To the Monkey the traveller
related his sad adventure, and the recital
touched the heart of the grateful animal.</p>

<p>The Monkey had lived in the forest so
long that he was not only familiar with
the habits of the robbers, but knew where
their abode was. To that he made haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
to go. He found the robbers asleep, with
many treasures by their side. He seized
bags of gold and silver and precious
stones, together with a supply of rich apparel,
and carried them to his benefactor.</p>

<p>Having recovered his hard-earned fortune,
the traveller thanked the Monkey,
and continued on his journey. He was
astonished that such a creature could be so
grateful, and reproached himself for never
having thought of the animal. He was
walking along in the midst of these reflections
when he heard a terrible roaring, and
a ferocious-looking Lion appeared before
him. The traveller was seized with terror.
He was so frightened that he leaned
against a tree to keep from falling to the
ground. To his surprise, the King of the
Forest spoke to him thus:</p>

<p>"Good-day, my friend, my deliverer!
It was you that saved my life. I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
show you my gratitude. Come into my
cavern and take a few moments' rest."</p>

<p>The conduct of the Monkey had somewhat
reconciled the traveller to the animals.
Whatever fear he might have had
in the presence of the Lion, the traveller
hoped that the King of Beasts would not
be less generous than the Monkey.</p>

<p>"I am happy to tell you," said the
Lion, after having heard about the Monkey,
"that gratitude ought to be the first
virtue of beasts, since it is not that of
man." At the same time the Lion
thought to himself&mdash;"How can I show
my gratitude to my dear deliverer, and
what can I do for him so as not to appear
inferior to the Monkey?"</p>

<p>He was filled with these reflections
when they arrived at the cavern. The
traveller was well taken care of by the
Lion. He dined most sumptuously, drank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
of the best wines, and ate of the most
delicious fruits. But while they were discussing
the dessert, the same distressing
thought came into the Lion's head&mdash;"What
can I do to retain my dignity and
pay the sacred debt I owe my deliverer?"</p>

<p>But he could not think of anything
suitable, and the traveller observed it. So
he said:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my friend? You
seem disconsolate."</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the Lion. "But you
must promise me that you will not leave
this place until I return."</p>

<p>"But why?" inquired the traveller.</p>

<p>"You will know later," responded the
lion.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the traveller, "here I
will remain."</p>

<p>The Lion bounded away, and he was
soon in the middle of the forest, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
this way and that, to the right and to the
left, in search of something marvellous to
give to the traveller, when all of a sudden
he saw the young Prince, the Vizier's
pupil, who had been exiled, promenading
in his castle grounds. On the Prince's
head there was a turban, which was ornamented
with a superb cluster of diamonds.</p>

<p>"That is the very thing," exclaimed the
Lion, and with one bound he seized the
Prince and strangled him. Thus was the
jeweller avenged, and his diamonds were
returned to him. The traveller, who had
been robbed and beaten by order of the
young Prince and his Vizier, was glad to
get his jewels back, and he did not know
how to be grateful enough to the Lion, of
whom he had formerly been afraid.</p>

<p>The traveller then set out toward the
city in hopes of finding his excellent friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Rustem. He hoped, indeed, to spend
some time with this philosopher, whom
he had rescued, and who had offered to
share his house with his benefactor. With
a happy heart and a light step the traveller
went on his way, and the next morning at
the break of day he reached the city where
the former Vizier had taken up his abode.
In spite of the early hour the streets were
crowded, and the squares were filled with
people. On all sides the populace spoke
to each other in subdued tones, as if some
dreadful calamity were pending.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the traveller was excited,
and he approached a group, and listened.
Some one was relating that the
young Prince, who had been exiled from
the court, had been found bleeding and
dead in the park of the castle. It was
thought that the murder of the Prince was
the work of some thief who desired to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
possession of the beautiful jewels that the
young man wore.</p>

<p>Having his curiosity satisfied, the traveller
made his way to the house of his
friend, the philosopher Rustem, where he
was received with open arms. According
to the wishes of his friend, the traveller
related all the particulars of his journey,
which were even more wonderful than are
related here. He told, in short, his whole
history. He told Rustem of all his troubles&mdash;how
he had been rescued by a Monkey,
and how he was met by a terrible Lion,
who was rejoiced to see him, and who had
given a sumptuous feast in his honor; and
who, thinking this not enough, had presented
him with a magnificent cluster of
diamonds.</p>

<p>After relating this extraordinary adventure,
the traveller made bold to exhibit
to Rustem the beautiful diadem, who regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
it with a greedy and knowing
look, and who made many exclamations
of surprise and admiration. The worthy
traveller did not foresee the troubles that
this unfortunate diadem was to cause
him. He did not know that it had been
the cause of the death of the son of the
King.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rustem was thinking to
himself, "I recognize these diamonds.
They belonged to my young master.
What a reward must be in store for the
one who will inform the monarch of the
murderer of his child!"</p>

<p>Night came, and the traveller was fast
asleep. The cluster of diamonds was lying
on a table. The cowardly Vizier seized it
and ran to the palace. The ingrate, cowardly
as he was, would not hesitate to sacrifice
his benefactor, provided he could
recover his lost power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is the property of the son whom
you have so rigorously punished. Do you
recognize these diamonds? I have in my
power the assassin who had possession of
this diadem."</p>

<p>The unfortunate King wept on seeing
the familiar ornament which his favorite
son had worn. He kissed it, and pressed
it to his heart as if it had been his favorite
child.</p>

<p>"Let the murderer be brought before
me," he exclaimed, "and he shall be
thrown into the darkest dungeon."</p>

<p>The unfortunate traveller, who was
ignorant of the crime of which he was
accused, was brought before the King
with trouble and confusion imprinted on
his features. He saw the perfidious Rustem
in the crowd that surrounded him,
and, remembering the wise counsels of the
Monkey and the Serpent, suspected that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
he had been made the victim of this treacherous
person.</p>

<p>"I deserve," he said, sadly, "the cruel
lot that is in store for me."</p>

<p>The King, mistaking the true meaning
of these words, thought that the prisoner
had been frightened into making a confession.
He was thereupon condemned to
be burned in the public square.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as this punishment was to
be witnessed by the whole populace, it
was postponed until after the funeral of
the young Prince. The poor traveller
was cast into the dungeon set apart for
the condemned. It was dark and clammy,
and on entering it he bade farewell to life
and happiness.</p>

<p>A friend, however, was watching over
the poor traveller. It was the Serpent he
had delivered from the pitfall. Cautiously
he crawled along the damp walls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
under the doors, and avoided the observation
of the jailers. The traveller recognized
him at once.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing," said the Serpent, "I
come to deliver you."</p>

<p>"How can you do that, my friend?"
asked the traveller.</p>

<p>"I have promised to redeem you from
the results of your own generosity, and I
am faithful to my promise. You refused
to believe that man is the most ungrateful
of the animals, and that he returns evil for
good. You have forgotten the good advice
given you by the Lion and the Monkey.
However, let us forget that. I will
be more cunning than the vile wretch who
is seeking your ruin."</p>

<p>"What must be done?" the traveller
asked.</p>

<p>"Take this herb. It alone has virtue to
cure the poison with which I have inoculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the King's favorite wife. The monarch
has now become a victim of the keenest
grief, and you alone can appease it.
He will soon forget the crime of which
you are accused. He who can make himself
useful is always innocent. Advertise
your talents; that is the way to success.
Apply the herb I have given you, and you
will perform miracles. Farewell! time
presses. Here comes the King to visit
you."</p>

<p>The traveller took the advice of the
Serpent, and it soon became known at the
court that he had an infallible remedy for
all sorts of poisons, and he was taken from
the dungeon and carried to the palace, and
to the apartment of the Queen. This estimable
lady was sick and pale, and it was
apparent that she was dying little by little.</p>

<p>The first application of the herb revived
the dying Queen, and when the remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
was applied the second time the gracious
lady found herself fully recovered.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," said the traveller, "the
Queen will never feel again the cruel pains
that she has suffered, and her life is hereafter
safe; but I am on the eve of terminating
mine&mdash;a fate that I have not
deserved. You are too just to punish an
innocent person, and I am not the murderer
of your son. That monster, Rustem,
had contaminated the Prince's youth, and
it was through his corrupt counsels that
the young Prince was dragged into disgrace.
You will know this villain better
when I prove to you that he is the most
ungrateful of human beings."</p>

<p>Then the traveller related to the King
the adventure in the pitfall and all that
followed. Convinced that the traveller
was telling the truth, the King ordered
that the ingrate Rustem should suffer all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the tortures that had been reserved for
the man who was a prisoner.</p>

<p>This perfidious creature, Rustem, was ignorant
of all that had taken place at the
palace, and was waiting with impatience
for the success of his treasonable plots.
He was aroused from his vain dreams of
greatness, seized, and hurried off to his
doom.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XIV<br />
<span class="small">THE ENCHANTED PRINCESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there lived in a far
country a young Prince, who desired nothing
better than to take to himself a wife,
but none of the women who had been presented
to him suited his fancy or touched
his heart.</p>

<p>"How is it," he cried, "that in all my
father's kingdom I am unable to find a
wife that suits me?"</p>

<p>The poor young Prince became disconsolate.
He shed burning tears, refused to
eat or drink, and dwindled away in the
sight of the sun. The King saw his son's
despair and took pity on him. So one
day he called the young Prince to him
and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>"My son, here is a gold key. Go to
the top of the highest tower of my castle,
and there you will find a door. Open it
and enter, and you will then see before
you the most beautiful and the most virtuous
women in the world. You can
have your choice. I hope you will find
among them the wife you desire."</p>

<p>Filled with joy, Prince Erian took the
golden key, climbed the long stairs leading
to the tower, and soon arrived at the
door his father had described. But there
was no lock in which he could place the
key. He searched in vain. Disappointed,
he returned to his father.</p>

<p>"I found the door," he said, "but the
key was useless. There was no lock."</p>

<p>"All that is necessary," the King replied,
"is to touch the door with your key,
and immediately it will swing back on its
ruby hinges, so that you may enter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince made haste to return to the
castle tower, and he had no sooner touched
the door with the key than it swung on its
ruby hinges.</p>

<p>Never since the day when the sun first
shone on this poor earth of ours, never
since the golden stars sparkled in the firmament,
has such a scene been presented
to the human eye as that which Prince Erian
saw before him. An immense hall, inlaid
with thousands of glistening diamonds,
sapphires as blue as the sky, and opals
with their changing hues, lay spread out
before the King's son, who stood dumb
with astonishment and admiration. There
were soft carpets everywhere, unmatchable
pictures, and bright-colored flowers.
Silver perfuming-pans swinging from their
golden chains, and filling the air with rich
incense, burned incessantly in this enchanted
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>There were twelve windows in this
wonderful hall, and in each window a
young girl stood, a living picture in a
frame. All were so beautiful and so graceful
that the young Prince was dazed.
Never in his wildest dreams had he caught
a glimpse of fairies quite so beautiful, and
even the water-nymphs that he had seen
disporting themselves on the water's edge
were not so charming.</p>

<p>Dazed and delighted as he was, there
was, nevertheless, a mystery that puzzled
the young Prince. In the first of the
twelve windows stood a young girl whose
head was covered with a gauze veil. She
alone had not turned when the King's
son entered. Prince Erian stepped to her
side and removed the veil.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me?" she asked,
sadly.</p>

<p>"Because," he replied, "you are the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
charming of all the marvellous beauties
that surround you; because you are like
the moon among the stars&mdash;like the rose
among the flowers of a garden."</p>

<p>"What do you desire of me?" the
young girl asked.</p>

<p>"Something that makes me tremble to
say it," responded Prince Erian. "I want
to make you my Queen, and live at your
side."</p>

<p>"Alas! to marry me you must rescue
me. I am the prisoner of the most powerful
magician of the earth. I am held
captive by Magor, the King of the Sorcerers."</p>

<p>"No matter!" cried the young Prince.
"I shall rescue you. I shall die if I do
not make you mine."</p>

<p>"May you be victorious over my deadly
enemy; but, unfortunate that I am!"
sighed the beautiful prisoner, "I fear you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
will share the sad fate of the many gallant
young princes who have wished to deliver
me from my bonds."</p>

<p>Quite happy, Prince Erian returned to
his father.</p>

<p>"Well," said the King, "did you meet
the lady of your dreams?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my father."</p>

<p>"Tell me: which did you choose?"</p>

<p>"The most beautiful of all," exclaimed
the Prince; "the fairest of the stars, the
rose that perfumes the gardens."</p>

<p>"The stars are all brilliant," said the
King, "and each flower sheds its perfume.
Answer me, my son; which is the
lady of your choice?"</p>

<p>"My father, it is the veiled lady."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate boy, you are lost!" cried
the monarch. "It is the Queen of Golconda,
the prisoner of Magor, the King of
the Magicians, that you have chosen. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
poor son! to make her your queen you
must take her away from that terrible sorcerer."</p>

<p>"Well, my father," cried the enthusiastic
young prince, "I will be her deliverer!"</p>

<p>"Alas, my son!" said the King, "I
fear you will fail, and then you will be
turned into a statue of stone."</p>

<p>"The risk is mine," cried Prince Erian.
"I shall overcome him."</p>

<p>"Ah, my son! your defeat is certain.
Remain with me."</p>

<p>"It is too late, my father, I cannot."</p>

<p>The princely lover lost no time in setting
out to conquer Magor, the King of
the Magicians, who held the beautiful
Princess in enchantment.</p>

<p>Prince Erian had been travelling for
several days, when he came to a gloomy
forest. Unfortunately, in passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
this dark forest, he lost his way, and in
spite of all his efforts, he could not find it
again. He wandered about in the woods
for some time when, suddenly, and as if
by magic, a stranger appeared before him.</p>

<p>"Good-day, friend!" exclaimed Prince
Erian. "What are you doing, and what
is your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Long," replied the other;
"and I am looking for a master who
needs my services."</p>

<p>"The master is already found," said the
young Prince. "If you give your consent
you shall serve me."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" exclaimed Long. "From
this day I am entirely subject to your
orders."</p>

<p>"For the present," said Prince Erian.
"I ask nothing of you except to help me
find my way out of this terrible forest."</p>

<p>"Is that all? Wait a moment." With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
this, Long stretched himself to such an
amazing extent that his head was above
the tallest trees of the forest.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked the astonished
Prince.</p>

<p>"I am trying to find our way out." In
a little while Long made himself short
again, no taller than an ordinary man.</p>

<p>"Well, have you found the road?" the
Prince inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Long. "We must
take the one to the right of you, and soon
we shall be out of this jungle."</p>

<p>So the Prince and his companion took
the road to the right and soon found themselves
clear of the impenetrable forest.
As they came to its borders they saw a
stout man sitting at the foot of a tree.
He was round as any barrel, and he sat
breathing heavily and wiping his face with
the back of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-day, my slim friend," said the
Prince. "What are you doing here, and
what is your name?"</p>

<p>"My father named me Large," replied
the stout man; "and I am resting in the
shade here, waiting for some one who
needs my services."</p>

<p>"Your services? And what can you
do, my man?" inquired the Prince.</p>

<p>Large made no reply. He simply
caused his body to expand to such an extent
that he filled the open field. Before
Prince Erian and Long could recover
from their astonishment, Large caused
himself to subside, being careful however,
not to collapse so suddenly as to create a
great storm.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said he, "can I be of service
to any one?"</p>

<p>"I think you can," the Prince answered;
"and since you possess such an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
talent, I will take you as my servant.
Come with me."</p>

<p>"Gladly!" exclaimed Large, and the
Prince and his two servants continued on
their way.</p>

<p>As the travellers drew near their journey's
end, they saw a man leaning against
an immense oak. He had a bandage over
his eyes, and he stood motionless, appearing
to be very much preoccupied.</p>

<p>"Take this unfortunate person into
your service," Long suggested to the
Prince. "Who knows but he may prove
to be of great assistance to you later on?"</p>

<p>"My friend," said Prince Erian, addressing
the stranger, "what is your name?"</p>

<p>"My father named me Keen Eyes,"
said the other.</p>

<p>"A pretty neat name for a blind man,"
remarked the Prince. "What can you
do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>"My trade is to see clearly," replied
Keen Eyes. "My eyes are bandaged so
that my sight may do no damage to the
objects I fix my gaze on."</p>

<p>"Really!" exclaimed Prince Erian; "if
your power is so great, give us an example
of it."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Keen Eyes. "Do you
see that immense rock yonder?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes on it! In an instant
it shall fly to pieces."</p>

<p>Keen Eyes removed his bandage,
looked steadily upon the imposing mass of
granite, and it seemed to melt before his
eyes; it crumbled and fell to pieces.</p>

<p>"My friend," said the Prince, "you are
an extraordinary man. If you will come
with me, I will take you as my servant."</p>

<p>Keen Eyes gladly accepted the offer.</p>

<p>After travelling a little farther, Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Erian and his servants, Long, Large, and
Keen Eyes, came upon a magnificent castle,
the walls of which were armored with iron
and brass. This castle belonged to the terrible
Magor, the King of the Magicians,
who held the Princess of Golconda in the
spell of his enchantment.</p>

<p>"This is the end of our journey," said
Prince Erian.</p>

<p>He then explained to his servants the
bold scheme he had in mind, and they
made an effort to enter at once into the
castle, but the door was made of brass and
it was barred and locked.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" said the young
Prince.</p>

<p>"Wait!" answered Keen Eyes. He
raised his bandage, gave the door one
glance and it crumbled into pieces. Without
further ceremony, the four travellers
entered the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>It was a wonderful place, this home
of the King of the Sorcerers. On every
side statues of gold and silver were to be
found, luminous flowers, and amidst all
the beauty, charming birds that spoke the
language of human beings.</p>

<p>In one room of the castle the travellers
found a table already set and covered
with the most palatable dishes and perfumed
wines. The Prince and his companions
were very hungry; so they sat
themselves down to the feast spread before
them, and ate a great deal and drank
a great deal more. After this excellent
meal, Prince Erian and his three servants
went out to walk in the beautiful garden.
They had scarcely gone ten paces when
they met Magor and his charming captive.
At sight of these unknown persons, the
Sorcerer stood dumb with amazement.
At last, full of rage, he cried out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you come here, miserable
creatures? Dare you even pretend to
take from me the pearl of pearls, the
beauty without rival that I have on my
arm, my pretty prisoner, the Princess of
Golconda?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Prince; "and all your
magic will serve to confound you, if you
do not use your superhuman art."</p>

<p>"So be it," assented Magor. "I will not
crush you like an earthworm. I will do
better. I will give you the lady of your
dreams, but upon one condition only."</p>

<p>"Name it!" cried Prince Erian.</p>

<p>"It is this: that during three days in
succession, and precisely at twelve o'clock,
you must present the Princess of Golconda
to me in the large hall of the Castle."</p>

<p>"That is an easy thing to do," said
Prince Erian.</p>

<p>"You are mad!" cried Magor. "Reflect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
before you accept the challenge, for
if you permit the Princess to escape all
will be over with you. That moment you
and your companions shall be changed
into statues."</p>

<p>"No matter," said the Prince. "I
accept."</p>

<p>"If, at the appointed hour," the King
of the Sorcerers explained, "you present
to me the Princess of Golconda, one of
the iron rings that I wear around my waist
will fall off, and if all three should break,
one after the other, you will be victorious
over me&mdash;over Magor, the King of the
Magicians."</p>

<p>Then Prince Erian took the arm of the
lady of his dreams, the beautiful Princess
of Golconda, and conducted her to the
hall that Magor had pointed out to him.
After the three days of the trial, the
charming Princess would be his own&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
his own. With what happiness, he
thought, would he present her to his
father! "Here," he would say, "is the
wife I have chosen. Magor, the King of
the Magicians, disputed my right to her,
and him I have overthrown!"</p>

<p>But what precautions they were compelled
to use! Prince Erian closed the
door carefully and then ordered Long to
stretch himself all around the hall. Large
was told to expand himself so as to stop
up the windows, and Keen Eyes was made
to loosen the bandage around his eyes.
When all these preparations had been
made, there was only a small space left for
the beautiful Princess and Prince Erian.</p>

<p>"Keen Eyes," said the young Prince,
"we must be careful; we must not fall
asleep; we must watch to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, master," responded Keen Eyes,
"we must drive away sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, worn out as they were,
they soon closed their eyes, and in a few
moments they were sound asleep.</p>

<p>At dawn the next day, Prince Erian
was the first to awake. But the beautiful
Princess had disappeared. The young
Prince, filled with mingled grief and astonishment,
called out to his companions:</p>

<p>"Awake, my friends! Awake!"</p>

<p>"What is the matter, master? What is
the matter?" they cried:</p>

<p>"An irreparable misfortune has befallen
me! The Princess has disappeared!
Search and see if you can find her anywhere."</p>

<p>Long, Large, and the young Prince
searched everywhere, examining every
piece of furniture, but they did not find
the beautiful young Princess.</p>

<p>"Alas!" they cried, "what shall we do?
we are lost!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait!" said Keen Eyes; "not yet!"
He had also been searching for the
Princess.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the young Prince,
"can you have found her?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Keen Eyes. "Four
hundred leagues away there is a forest.
In this forest there is a tree. On this tree
there is a limb. On this limb there is an
acorn."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well?" cried Prince Erian.</p>

<p>"And in that acorn is the Princess."</p>

<p>"Then all is lost!" exclaimed the young
Prince. "To travel four hundred leagues
and return by noon is an impossibility."</p>

<p>"Do not give up all hope, my master,"
said Long. "Wait a little while."</p>

<p>Keen Eyes got on Long's shoulders, and
Long stretched himself out so that with a
few leaps he was in the forest and then at
the tree. Keen Eyes took possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the precious acorn. Long drew his great
length together, and in a moment they had
returned.</p>

<p>Prince Erian took the acorn, broke it
open, and out stepped the Princess, more
beautiful and more resplendent than ever.</p>

<p>All this time, Magor, the King of the
Sorcerers, was laughing to himself and enjoying
the neat trick he had played on the
young Prince and his companions. At
precisely twelve o'clock he presented himself
at the door of the hall, and cried out:</p>

<p>"Ah, well! faithful guardian! Can you
show me the beautiful Princess?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly," replied Prince Erian.
"Behold her here!"</p>

<p>A cry of rage broke from the Magician.
A band of iron broke from his body and
fell at his feet.</p>

<p>"But wait!" cried Magor. "Watch
well to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>"Be not uneasy," said Prince Erian.
"Meanwhile permit us to promenade in
your magnificent garden."</p>

<p>They inspected the palace from top to
bottom and went through the garden.
They saw some very strange things, and
much that they saw was calculated to
make a very serious impression on their
minds. That which most affected the
friends of the young Princess was the
spectacle of a wall along which were
ranged the statues of many Knights.</p>

<p>Some stood with clubs uplifted as if for
combat. Others were in an attitude of
supplication, while still others, with muscles
strained and eyes filled with fire,
seemed to be having a hand-to-hand contest
with the terrible Sorcerer; but they
had all been vanquished and turned to
stone by his power.</p>

<p>"These unfortunate men," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Princess, "have been transformed into
statues for attempting to rescue me from
the King of the Magicians. I have been
the innocent cause of the misfortune of
these brave men, and I bring misery to
all who interest themselves in my sad
fate."</p>

<p>"Then why do you not fly from
this desolate palace?" Prince Erian asked.
"Are you never free from this Magician?
He has such power over you?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied the Princess, "I am
not the mistress of my destiny, and when
the King of the Magicians commands
me I must obey. His power over me is
boundless. He can change me into a
bird that flies, into a grain of dust blown
about by the wind, or into a flower that
perfumes the garden. He can send me
a million leagues away, and I can neither
resist his caprice nor oppose his cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
tyranny. Those who love me perish.
He is so powerful, the others are so
weak!"</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" exclaimed the Prince,
"I shall not die, I will deliver you
from the talons of this cruel vulture! I
will take you away from this castle, a
thousand times accursed since it is your
prison!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the Princess, "I fear that
you also will suffer defeat. Are you a
magician, are you a sorcerer, that you
can contend against Magor?"</p>

<p>"I am neither magician nor sorcerer,"
replied the enthusiastic young Prince;
"but I have all the power of both, since
I love you. Do not despair. Let me do
as I wish. My friends, with their extraordinary
gifts, are your friends, and
they are devoted to your cause."</p>

<p>"We will deliver you!" "We will deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
you!" exclaimed Long, Large, and
Keen Eyes.</p>

<p>"May you succeed!" sighed the unhappy
Princess. "But my hopes have
been dashed to the ground so many times
that I dare not depend on anyone."</p>

<p>All day long the young Princess of
Golconda and Prince Erian walked together
and were happy, forgetting for the
time the terrible contest that was to take
place, the outcome of which was wrapped
in so much uncertainty.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Princess disappeared. Magor,
the King of the Magicians, had called
her.</p>

<p>The sun was disappearing little by little
below the horizon, and its golden
rays were fading before the approaching
night.</p>

<p>All disconsolate, Prince Erian turned
his steps toward the castle. His anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
for the Princess was extreme, but, with
joyful surprise, he found her awaiting him
at the door.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my Prince!" she said, and
together they entered the castle.</p>

<p>An elegant repast was spread. The
most delicate dishes, the most exquisite
wines, burdened the table.</p>

<p>"Come, my friends!" cried the Sorcerer,
"eat, drink, and be merry! This
may be your last meal."</p>

<p>"Don't worry yourself, gentle sir," answered
Long. "To-morrow you may be
kept busy in the kitchen again. Rest
assured you will always find us in good
health and with hearty appetites."</p>

<p>"We shall see about that," said Magor.
"You found my prisoner in an acorn; you
travelled four hundred leagues to bring
her back to this palace; but all that is a
very simple matter. To-morrow your task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
will not be such an easy one. Am I not
the King of the Magicians?"</p>

<p>"Just so," remarked Long; "but you
are one and we are four."</p>

<p>When supper was over, the Princess
was given into the care of Prince Erian.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" said Magor with a
mocking smile. "Be sure that you watch
more faithfully to-night, or the fair lady
of your dreams will elude you."</p>

<p>"Make yourself easy," replied the
Prince. "Should she escape we know
how to find her."</p>

<p>When they arrived at the hall where
the trial was to be renewed, the Princess
said to her companions:</p>

<p>"I know that you are very powerful,
but the cruel Magor is still more powerful.
Redouble your precautions; remain
awake and perhaps you may succeed in
rescuing me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>"Trust to us," answered Prince Erian.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary precautions
were taken, but all to no purpose. While
Prince Erian and the Princess of Golconda
were chatting together, sleep fell
upon the small company little by little.
The wicked Sorcerer had drugged their
wine, and the effect was irresistible.</p>

<p>"Keen Eyes," said the Prince, drowsily,
"are you awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my master," answered Keen
Eyes with a yawn. "Fear nothing!"</p>

<p>But immediately his eyelids became
heavy, and every effort he made to keep
awake only made him sleep all the more
soundly.</p>

<p>Magor, the King of the Magicians, found
it an easy matter to carry off his lovely
captive through a very small aperture that
Large had left open when he fell asleep.</p>

<p>At sunrise Prince Erian awoke and discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
that the Princess of Golconda had
disappeared. He called to his companions:</p>

<p>"Long! Large! Keen Eyes! where are
you? Quick! the Princess has disappeared!
This is our last day if we do not
find her at once!"</p>

<p>They searched on all sides, but without
success.</p>

<p>"Do not distress yourself," said Keen
Eyes, to the young Prince, who was lamenting.
"See! A thousand leagues
from here&mdash;farther than the sea, farther
than the mountains&mdash;there is a broad and
waving field of wheat. In that field of
wheat there is a ridge. On that ridge there
is a stalk. On that stalk there is an ear.
In that ear there is a grain. In that grain
the beautiful Princess is hid."</p>

<p>Once more Keen Eyes mounted the
shoulders of Long, who stretched himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
again&mdash;stretched and took such long steps
that in an hour's time he had crossed seas
and mountains and reached the wheatfield.
The two friends released the Princess
from her floury prison, and in a short
time were back at the castle.</p>

<p>Prince Erian had been awaiting their
return, tortured by the agony of suspense.
It is impossible to describe his joy in beholding
once more the beautiful lady of
his dreams. He laughed and sang and
seemed almost beside himself. He could
scarcely keep his eyes off the Princess
even for a moment. Suddenly there came
a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>Blam&mdash;blam! Blam!</p>

<p>"Come in!" said the Prince Erian.</p>

<p>It was the King of the Magicians who
entered. He smiled mockingly.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my heroes!" he exclaimed,
"are you as joyous to-day as you were yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
at this hour, and can you present
the Princess to me?"</p>

<p>"It is my pleasure to do so," said Prince
Erian, with mock courtesy. "Behold the
Princess here!"</p>

<p>The Sorcerer grew pale with anger, and
his eyes shot forth fire. A second band
of iron fell from his waist and broke.</p>

<p>"One day still remains, and this time
we shall see who is the conqueror," said
Magor, furious with rage. Thus speaking
he retired to an apartment in his palace,
where he remained throughout the day,
scheming to outwit Prince Erian and his
companions. He now realized that he
had met adversaries who were dangerous,
and he knew that the contest of the next
day would be final. What could he do to
hide the beautiful captive? At last he
thought he had found a way and a sigh
of relief escaped his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince Erian and his companions
were taking counsel together.
They were filled with anxiety. They
knew that the King of the Magicians
would use all his art to carry off and conceal
the beautiful Princess. They knew,
too, that if they failed to find her their
fate was sealed. They would take their
places among the unfortunate knights
who had been transformed into statues.</p>

<p>That night they took unusual precautions,
but all was in vain, for when
they awoke the next morning the Princess
of Golconda had again disappeared.</p>

<p>"Awake, friends! Arise!" cried the
young Prince, when he made the discovery.
"The Princess is gone? Let us
search for her."</p>

<p>Long and willingly they searched, but
all in vain. Keen Eyes himself was puzzled.
He looked into the sky and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
earth, penetrated the mountains, and
looked into the bottom of the precipice.
He could see nothing that resembled the
beautiful young Princess.</p>

<p>"Ah, well!" cried Prince Erian. "The
Sorcerer is stronger than we. This time
we are lost."</p>

<p>The sun was already high up in the
heavens, and the time was approaching
when the King of the Magicians was to
make his appearance and demand the
Princess.</p>

<p>But Keen Eyes did not despair. His
keen glance searched everywhere. Suddenly
he gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Victory! victory! The Princess is
ours! I have discovered her hiding-place."</p>

<p>"Where is it?" cried Prince Erian.
"Quick! Time is precious."</p>

<p>"Do you see yonder&mdash;away yonder in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the Black Sea," said Keen Eyes, pointing
as eagerly as if all eyes were as keen as his&mdash;"do
you see that wave rocked by the
hurricane, ascending to the surface and
descending to the depths of the abyss,
pushed here and thrown there by the
storm? In the centre of that tremendous
wave there is a void. In that void is a ring.
In that ring is your beautiful Princess."</p>

<p>"What shall we do, my friends? What
shall we do?" cried the young Prince.</p>

<p>"Large," said Keen Eyes, by way of answer,
"get on Long's shoulders with me.
He will take us to the shore of the sea
where the storm-tossed wave is swimming."</p>

<p>Large obeyed, and at once and swiftly
they made their way to the sea&mdash;swifter
than the north wind they travelled, over
plains and over mountains, past rivers and
hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"Faster, faster!" cried Keen Eyes.</p>

<p>They reached the sea, but their difficulty
was not over. How should they get possession
of the storm-tossed wave? Long
stretched himself and pursued it, but when
he thought he held it, it would slip from
his hands and disappear.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Large. "I am going to
get it."</p>

<p>Then he began to drink, drink, drink,
so rapidly that the wave with the void in
its centre was at last brought within reach,
so that the ring could be seized.</p>

<p>What an extraordinary sight it was to
see a man as big as the thickest mountains,
casting his shadow over the entire country,
his head reaching beyond the clouds
that floated in the sky. Large's immense
size can be imagined. He had been compelled
to drink the greater part of the sea
so as to get possession of the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>Having found the Princess at last, Long
and Keen Eyes started on their return
journey to the magician's castle.</p>

<p>But they had lost so much time trying
to capture the ring that contained the
Princess that the hour of noon was about
to strike.</p>

<p>"Courage&mdash;courage!" cried Long. His
immense strides carried him over hills
and ravines, vast plains and dense forests.
In a minute they will be at the
castle. Forward! Quick! Fast and still
faster.</p>

<p>"We are lost!" exclaimed Keen Eyes.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Long, "we are here!"
He made a supreme effort, and, at one
stride, reached the castle. As he came to
the door, he saw the Magician about to
enter.</p>

<p>"Let me pass!" demanded Keen Eyes.</p>

<p>"After me, if you please," said Magor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p>"Infamous Sorcerer!" exclaimed Keen
Eyes, "I must enter!"</p>

<p>"After me, I said," responded Magor.</p>

<p>But while they were disputing Long
threw the enchanted ring through the window,
and when the King of the Magicians
entered the hall, the Princess of Golconda,
more beautiful than ever, received him.</p>

<p>The clock struck the hour of noon!</p>

<p>At sight of the Princess, the King of
the Magicians trembled and a terrible cry
burst from his lips. Then, transforming
himself into a raven, he disappeared in
space.</p>

<p>The third iron band had fallen from
Magor's waist and broken.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a marvellous change was
taking place. The spell of the wicked
Sorcerer was destroyed. The statues
came to life. On all sides gay laughter
and joyous songs could be heard, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
might have thought that these people,
Knights and Princes, were the invited
guests at a wedding.</p>

<p>And so they were, for the marriage of
the beautiful Princess of Golconda took
place at once, and the guests were the
Knights and Princes who had been restored
to life. All of them took part in
the festivities, and at daybreak they were
still dancing in the Sorcerer's castle.</p>

<p>As soon as possible Prince Erian and
his charming Princess turned their steps
in the direction of that distant city where
the aged King was waiting with impatience
for his beloved son. Large had
not yet returned, but Long went after
him, and, all together, they wended their
way toward the palace where Prince Erian
first saw the light.</p>

<p>The joy of the Prince's parents cannot
be described. They were never tired of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
embracing their child. They overwhelmed
him with questions, and then kissed and
caressed him, and thus prevented him from
talking. Nor was the beautiful Princess
forgotten; each one embraced her, and received
her as Prince Erian's wife should
be received.</p>

<p>The festivities lasted many days, and
when they were over, Long, Large, and
Keen Eyes asked to leave the Prince.</p>

<p>"Why leave me?" said Prince Erian.
"You know how much I owe you, and
whether I love you. Remain with me
always."</p>

<p>"No," replied Keen Eyes, "the palace
stifles us, and the fine clothes we wear are
uncomfortable. We are useless at this
court."</p>

<p>"I will make you princes," said Prince
Erian; "I will make you kings, if you will
assist me in all my undertakings."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>"Men of our kind," said Long, "give
kingdoms but receive none. At odd times,
dear prince, we shall visit you. May we
always find you happy and contented."</p>

<p>Then bowing low to Prince Erian,
Long, Large, and Keen Eyes sighed and
disappeared.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>XV<br />
<span class="small">LOONY JOHN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When Loony John was born, his
mother leaned her head sadly on her hand
and murmured:</p>

<p>"What will become of this boy later?
Will he be wicked or innocent, rich or
poor, intelligent or a simpleton?"</p>

<p>"He will be rich," answered a little
fairy. Her voice seemed to come from
the rafters.</p>

<p>"He will be poor," said a second one.</p>

<p>"Intelligent," said a third.</p>

<p>Then a fourth voice made itself heard&mdash;"Your
child will never be anything but
a simpleton."</p>

<p>The unhappy mother recognized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
voice. She had heard it one day when
she refused to take pity on an old beggar-woman,
and now she knew that the
woman was no other than the Queen of
the Fairies in disguise.</p>

<p>The child grew and thrived, and when
he was sixteen, his mother said:</p>

<p>"My son, I have many trials. We are
poor and I want you to learn a trade.
What do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"You do not want to work?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," answered Loony John;
"work is tiresome."</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought the poor mother, "the
Queen of the Fairies is taking her revenge."</p>

<p>Some days afterward the good woman
needed a trivet, and sent her son to
buy it.</p>

<p>Loony John ran to the city and bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
a splendid one, and was returning home
contentedly, when he found that the trivet
was too heavy. So he sat it down and
addressed it:</p>

<p>"There is the road that leads to our
home. You have three feet and I have
but two. Run on ahead and be sure not
to stop on the way, for my mother needs
your services."</p>

<p>Loony John put his hands in his pockets
and went whistling along the road.</p>

<p>"Where is the trivet?" demanded his
mother when he reached home.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" exclaimed Loony John,
"is it not already here? The lazy thing
must have lagged on the way. With its
three feet it should have been here a good
quarter of an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the mother, "the trivet is
lost. What a simpleton you are to talk
to a piece of iron as if it had life. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
should have put it in your sack and carried
it on your shoulders."</p>

<p>"Well, mother," answered Loony John,
"another time I shall know what to
do."</p>

<p>One day Loony John's mother concluded
to celebrate the birthday of her
oldest daughter, and some wine was
needed for the invited guests, and Loony
John was sent after it to a neighboring
village. As he was returning, he remembered
what his mother said about putting
the trivet in a sack.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ho!" he cried. "I was about to
make a serious blunder. If I carry this
wine to the house in a jug they will scold
me. If a trivet should be put in a sack
why not the wine!"</p>

<p>So he poured it into his sack.</p>

<p>"Where is the wine?" he was asked
when he returned home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>"I had no sooner put it in the sack than
it ran away on all sides."</p>

<p>"Did you not have a jug?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"What a misfortune!" his mother said.
"You should have carried it on your head."</p>

<p>Loony John said he would do better
next time.</p>

<p>Not long after this, he was sent for a
servant who had been engaged to watch
the young turkeys.</p>

<p>"This time," said Loony John, "I shall
be careful to make no mistake."</p>

<p>He soon found the servant, who was a
young girl, and said to her:</p>

<p>"We have no time to lose. Let us be
off. Come! get on my head and let's
go."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thank you, sir," the young girl
answered, laughingly. "You are too good.
I can walk very well on my feet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>But Loony John was not to be put off
in this way. He remembered that he had
been told to carry the wine on his head, and
as the new servant showed no inclination
to obey him he gave her a terrible beating.
She fell almost lifeless by the roadside.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ho!" cried Loony John, "you
think you will have me scolded again to-day;
but I am not so fond of a scolding,
I can assure you."</p>

<p>Without delay he placed the poor girl
on his head and carried her home, where
he arrived well-nigh exhausted.</p>

<p>"What is it you have there?" his
mother cried.</p>

<p>"It is our new servant I bring you."</p>

<p>"Oh, what an unhappy creature I am!"
exclaimed the mother. She hastened to
put the servant to bed. The poor girl's
arms were broken and her shoulders
bruised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>During the fortnight that followed,
Loony John was sent on no errands. But
the servant girl grew steadily worse, and
one morning the doctor had to be sent
for. There was no one to go but Loony
John, and accordingly he was sent.</p>

<p>"Ask for only one," his mother cautioned
him.</p>

<p>"Have no fear," answered Loony John,
and he went on his way yelling as loud
as he could:</p>

<p>"Let only one come! Let only one
come!"</p>

<p>The road led by a river, and as Loony
John was going along, he saw a fisherman
who, since early morning, had been
throwing out his line without success.
Loony John's song did not please him.</p>

<p>"Silly scamp!" he exclaimed, "say
'Let a thousand come!' if you want to
save your bones."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately Loony John cried out:</p>

<p>"Let a thousand come! Let a thousand
come!"</p>

<p>He went on and came to a wood where
a shepherd was struggling with a fierce-looking
wolf. The contest seemed to interest
him. He sat down quietly on a
stone and awaited results.</p>

<p>The struggle was long and furious, but
the man at last overpowered the beast,
and the wolf fell mortally wounded.
While the shepherd was recovering from
his exertions he heard a strange refrain.
Loony John was yelling:</p>

<p>"Let a thousand come! Let a thousand
come!"</p>

<p>The shepherd rose to his feet, furious.</p>

<p>"You young rascal! Say, rather, 'May
the Imp seize him!'"</p>

<p>At once Loony John took up the new
refrain and went on his way crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<p>"May the Imp seize him! May the
Imp seize him!"</p>

<p>Presently he met a funeral procession,
but he still continued his cry.</p>

<p>"Will you hush?" said one in the procession.
"If you must go yelling along
the road, cry out, 'May the Lord protect
him!'"</p>

<p>Loony John was willing&mdash;none more
so&mdash;and very soon the echoes were repeating:</p>

<p>"May the Lord protect him! May
the Lord protect him!"</p>

<p>At the entrance of the village where
the doctor lived, a house was on fire, and
a crowd of people were trying to put it
out. Some wicked person had set it on
fire and he had been caught. He was
safely tied, and those who were not helping
to put out the fire were engaged in jeering
and insulting the wicked incendiary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>Loony John also wanted to see the culprit,
but for fear he would forget what he
had been told to say, he kept on repeating:</p>

<p>"May the Lord protect him! May the
Lord protect him!"</p>

<p>The crowd was indignant, and on all
sides were heard cries of "Here is his accomplice!"
Immediately Loony John was
seized and beaten, and, in spite of his tears
and entreaties, was thrown into prison.</p>

<p>How he escaped need not be told.
There is an old saying, "A fool for luck!"
and it is a true one. Loony John got back
home somehow.</p>

<p>Some time afterward Easter Sunday
came, and when Loony John's mother
started to church she said:</p>

<p>"Above all things, don't forget to put
the hen in the stew-pan."</p>

<p>"I will certainly do that," he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<p>The good woman went off, leaving Loony
John very much perplexed. He did
not know which hen his mother wanted.
So, after thinking the matter over, he went
into the hen-house and said:</p>

<p>"Which one of you is to be cooked for
dinner?"</p>

<p>"Cluck&mdash;cluck&mdash;cluck!" answered a
setting hen.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! don't talk Dutch!" protested
Loony John; "I can't understand you."</p>

<p>"Cluck&mdash;cluck&mdash;cluck!" said the setting
hen.</p>

<p>Loony John was more puzzled than ever,
but he repeated the question:</p>

<p>"Answer! Which one of you is to be
eaten for dinner to-day?"</p>

<p>By this time the frightened chickens
had all run out of the house into the garden,
leaving only the old setting hen who
had been answering Loony John in Dutch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! you are the one! Very well!"</p>

<p>Loony John seized her and put her in
the stew-pan alive. Then he began to
think, and he remembered that the eggs
were not hatched and that the nest was
without a hen.</p>

<p>"My mother did not think of that,"
said Loony John, and at once he went and
sat on the nest in the hen's place.</p>

<p>When his mother returned home she
called for her son.</p>

<p>"John! Oh, John! where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here, in a corner of the hen-house!"</p>

<p>"Where?" exclaimed the mother. "I
do not see you."</p>

<p>"Cluck&mdash;cluck&mdash;cluck!" said Loony
John.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer?" cried his
mother.</p>

<p>"Cluck&mdash;cluck&mdash;cluck!" said Loony
John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>His mother at last found him quietly
sitting on the eggs.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" she
asked, angrily.</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;h!" replied Loony John. "Don't
make any noise. I am setting."</p>

<p>"Did you put the hen in the stew-pan?"</p>

<p>"Cluck&mdash;cluck&mdash;cluck!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" inquired
the good woman. "Speak!"</p>

<p>"I say that I am setting!" said Loony
John, "and I will fly off the nest and
scratch in the garden if you continue to
disturb me in this manner."</p>

<p>"Why do you set?" his mother asked.</p>

<p>"Because the hen that sat on these eggs
is about to boil."</p>

<p>"Why, that is not the hen that was to
be cooked for dinner to-day, but the one
that I picked yesterday and put in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
cupboard!" The good woman shook her
head in despair and went away.</p>

<p>How long Loony John sat on the nest
cannot be told, but one day, some time
afterward, he was passing by a farm where
he saw a woman picking a chicken and
carefully placing the feathers to one side.
Loony John was very much interested in
this, and so he said to her:</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, tell me what you are
doing with those feathers?"</p>

<p>The woman was not without humor,
and she replied:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask such a simple question?
I am going to plant the feathers,
of course. Doesn't your mother plant the
feathers she picks from chickens?"</p>

<p>"My gracious! No!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, it is because she doesn't
own any Catchmeddler hens."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you plant the feathers?" inquired
Loony John.</p>

<p>"Well, well! your country must be a
very poor place, young man. Is it possible
you don't know that one of these
feathers, carefully cultivated, will yield
each month a fat, frying-size chicken?"</p>

<p>"If that is so," said Loony John, "sell
me two hundred dollars' worth of your
largest and finest feathers."</p>

<p>The woman laughed in her sleeve. She
had never dreamed that an old hen could
bring her so much money. She hastened
to close the trade with Loony John, and,
to show that she was not at all picayunish,
she threw in the two feet of the old hen
for good measure.</p>

<p>Loony John went on his way happy.
When he reached home he got the hoe,
went out into the garden, and began to
plant his fine feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<p>"How everybody will admire my fine
square of feathers!" he said to himself.
"I will call to every passer-by and say,
'Behold the beautiful hen-patch! Has
ever such a wonder been seen before?'"</p>

<p>The next week, however, Loony John
went all in tears to find the farm-woman.</p>

<p>"Well, well! my good young man!"
exclaimed the woman when she saw him,
"what do you cry for? Has your house
been burnt?"</p>

<p>"That would be but a trifle," replied
Loony John.</p>

<p>"Alas! is your mother dead?"</p>

<p>"That would be an irreparable misfortune,
but after awhile we should become
reconciled."</p>

<p>"What plague has fallen upon you?"</p>

<p>"The hail!" cried Loony John; "the
hail that uprooted my beautiful chicken
feathers. The wind also came among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
them and scattered them over the country.
Do not scold me! I have hunted for
them, but I cannot find a single one."</p>

<p>"We should have thought about the
possibility of a storm," said the shrewd
woman. "It was not hens you should
have cultivated, my young friend, but
sausages&mdash;for sausages will withstand the
wind and hail."</p>

<p>"But how would the sausages grow?"
asked Loony John, drying his tears.</p>

<p>"Why, like apples and cherries; but the
trees, instead of producing these fruits,
bear beautiful sausages. People who are
not educated think that sausages are only
made by those who deal in meat. But
surely you know better," said the shrewd
woman.</p>

<p>Loony John tried to hide his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Who would be so simple-minded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
not to know that?" he replied. "For how
much, ma'am, will you sell the sausages
you speak of?"</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars apiece, if they are for
yourself," answered the woman.</p>

<p>"I'll take a dozen," said Loony John,
with the air of a fine trader. "I shall
need no more to-day."</p>

<p>The shrewd woman brought Loony
John a dozen old sausages and carefully
wrapped them up. He paid for them on
the spot, and then, forgetting his first misfortune&mdash;the
wind and the hail&mdash;he returned
home singing.</p>

<p>Loony John grew older as the days
went by. A beard appeared on his face.
He even took to himself a wife; but he
still remained Loony John.</p>

<p>One day, when the sun was shining
brightly, he dressed himself in his new
suit of clothes, put on his best hat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
gloves, and went to the fair in the neighboring
village. He enjoyed himself, and
created a great deal of amusement for
others by his queer blunders. In the afternoon
the thought occurred to him that
his wife would be expecting him at home,
and so he started to return.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a shower came up, just
as he was crossing a bridge. Big drops of
rain were falling on all sides. In a little
while his fine hat, his new clothes, and his
gloves that he was so proud of would be
ruined.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious!" cried Loony
John, "if I suffer myself to get wet like
this I shall be called a simpleton indeed,
and my friends will have good cause to
laugh at me. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>Suddenly he shouted for joy. A wonderful
idea had struck him.</p>

<p>"I will throw myself in the river!" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
exclaimed. "Once in the water, it will
be impossible for the rain to wet my
clothes."</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Into the
water jumped Loony John. He couldn't
swim and so he was drowned. The next
day the miller found the body in the
water. He drew it out, and Loony John
was buried with great pomp. On his
tombstone was an inscription in Latin,
which, being interpreted, reads:</p>

<p class="center in0 p2t"><span class="smcap">Here Lies</span><br />
<span class="smcap xlarge">loony john</span><br />
<span class="smcap">who<br />
Jumped Into the Water<br />

From Getting Wet</span>.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
